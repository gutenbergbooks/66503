<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>IN WHICH A GREAT EXPLORER LISTENS AT MIDNIGHT<br />
TO A TALE OF LOVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Louis le Grand</span>, King of France and Navarre,
has deserted pleasure to follow piety&mdash;and
times are changed, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker, Louis de Sancerre, of Languedoc,
descendant of a famous constable of France,
leaned against a tree near the shore of a majestic
river, and musingly watched the moonbeams as
they chased the ripples toward an unknown sea.
A soft, cool breeze, heavy with the odor of new-born
flowers, caressed his pale, clear-cut face, and
toyed with the ruffles and trappings of a costume
more becoming at Versailles than in the mysterious
wilderness through which its wearer had
floated for many weeks.</p>

<p>On the bank at the exiled courtier&#8217;s feet lay
reclining the martial figure of a man, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
stern, immobile face, lofty brow, and piercing
eyes told a tale of high resolve and stubborn
will. Sieur de la Salle, winning his way to immortality
through wastes of swamp and canebrake
and the windings of a great river, had
made his camp at a bend in the stream from
which the outlook seemed to promise the fulfilment
of his dearest hopes. On the crest of a low
hill, sloping gently to the water, his followers had
thrown up a rude fort of felled trees, and now at
midnight the adventurous Frenchmen and their
score of Indian allies were tasting sleep after a
day of wearisome labor.</p>

<p>De la Salle and a hapless waif from the splendid
court of Louis XIV., more sensitive than
their subordinates to the grandeur of the undertaking
in which they were engaged, had felt no
wish to slumber. They had strolled away from
the silent camp; and, for the first time since
Count Louis de Sancerre had joined the expedition,
its leader had been learning something of
the flippant, witty, reckless, debonair courtier&#8217;s
career.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beware the omnipresent ear of the Great
Order, Monsieur le Comte!&#8221; exclaimed La Salle,
rising to his elbow and searching the shadows
behind him with questioning eyes. &#8220;Think not,
de Sancerre, that in the treacherous quiet of this
wilderness you may safely speak your mind. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
have good reason to distrust the trees, the waters,
and the roving winds. Where I go are ever
savages or silence, but always in my ear echoes
the stealthy footfall of the Jesuit. And this is
well, monsieur. I seize this country in the name
of France; the Order takes it in the name of
God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the name of God!&#8221; repeated de Sancerre,
mockingly. &#8220;You know Versailles, monsieur?
There is no room for God. Banished once by a
courtesan, the Almighty now succumbs to a confessor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold, monsieur!&#8221; cried La Salle, sternly.
&#8220;This is blasphemy! Blasphemy and treason!
But enough of priests! You tell me that you
loved this woman from the court of Spain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I say? What is love, monsieur?&#8221;
exclaimed de Sancerre, lightly, throwing himself
down beside his leader.</p>

<p>It was as if a butterfly, born of the moonbeams,
had come to ask a foolish riddle of the
grim forest glades. The incarnation of all that
was most polished, insincere, diabolical, fascinating
at Versailles had taken the form of a handsome
man, not quite forty years of age, who
reclined at midnight upon the banks of an unexplored
river, and pestered the living embodiment
of high adventure and mighty purposes with the
light and airy nothings of a courtier&#8217;s tongue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
How should Sieur de la Salle know the mystery
of love? He who had wooed hardship to win
naught but the kiss of disappointment, he who
had cherished no mistress save the glory of
France, no passion but for King and Church,
was not a source from which a flippant worldling
could wring a definition of the word of
words.</p>

<p>The majestic silence of the night was broken
by the raucous muttering of some restless
dreamer within the confines of the camp. An
owl hooted, and far away a wolf bayed at the
moon. La Salle arose, climbed the bank to see
that his sentries were attentive at their posts,
and then returned to Count de Sancerre&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not answer me, Sieur de la Salle!&#8221;
exclaimed the latter, testily. &#8220;I have sought
the answer from La Fontaine, from Moli&ecirc;re, Racine;
aye, from Bossuet and F&eacute;nelon. &#8217;Twas all
in vain. They were men, you say, and did not
understand? But I have asked the question of
de Montespan, la Valli&egrave;re, la Fayette, S&ecirc;vign&eacute;.
One was witty, another silent, and all were wrong.
There remained, of course, de Maintenon. Her
I never asked. She would have said, I doubt
not, that love is a priest who leads by prayer to
power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wander far afield, Monsieur le Comte,&#8221;
remarked La Salle, coldly, after an interval of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
silence. &#8220;The night grows old, and still you
have not told me why you left the splendors
that you love, to risk your life in this fierce
struggle in an unknown land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To risk my life?&#8221; cried the Count, laughingly.
&#8220;If that were all! To tear my velvets where
no draper is, to see the gay-plumed birds a-laughing
at my plight, to long in vain for powder for
my wig, to find my buckles growing red with
damp&mdash;all this is worse than death. But still, I
bear it bravely, do I not? Ah, well, Turenne&mdash;God
rest his soul!&mdash;taught me the lessons of a
hard campaign. What is this voyage in a bark
canoe upon the peaceful breast of yonder stream?
A pleasure-jaunt, monsieur, to one who fought
with France against the world&mdash;who sheathed
his sword at Nimeguen. Once only were we
beaten, de la Salle. The Dutch let in the sea,
and, lo! his Majesty and Luxembourg, Turenne
and Cond&eacute;, Vauban and the rest, were powerless
against the mighty ally of the foe. I say to you,
Monsieur le Capitaine, beware the sea! You
seek it in your quest. &#8217;Tis full of treachery.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count had arisen and drawn his sword,
which gleamed in the moonlight as he turned
its point toward the unknown mouth the roving
river sought.</p>

<p>&#8220;This blade,&#8221; he said, reseating himself and
patting the steel with affection, &#8220;flashed gayly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
for the King upon the Rhine. Alas for me, it
drove me at the last to seek my fortunes in a
weary land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You drew it, then, for something other than
the cause of France?&#8221; remarked La Salle, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;For that of which we spoke, which no tongue
voices but all hearts have felt. I drew it once
for love&mdash;<i>et voil&agrave; tout</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You killed a Spaniard, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They speak the truth, monsieur, who say your
mind is quick. She&mdash;as I told you&mdash;came to
France with Spain&#8217;s great embassy. He, a strutting
grandee, proud and bigoted, came with the
suite, holding some post that made his person
safe. The tool of diplomats, the pet of priests,
my rival&mdash;as he was&mdash;defied my hate. &#8217;Tis said
they were betrothed, Don Josef and&mdash; But hold!
her name I need not speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count remained silent for a time, watching
the moon-kissed waters at his feet. La Salle,
grim, reticent, but not unsympathetic, gazed steadfastly
at his companion&#8217;s delicately-carved face.
A stern knight-errant, who sought to win an empire
for his king, lay wasting the midnight hours
to listen to a love-tale from a flippant tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas with this blade,&#8221; went on de Sancerre
after a time, waving his sword from side to side
in the moonlight, &#8220;that I pierced his heart&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
broke my own. For which all praise be to Saint
Maturin, who watches over fools.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was no coward, then?&#8221; questioned La
Salle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not when his pride was pricked,&#8221; answered
de Sancerre. &#8220;Great wars have been begun with
less diplomacy than I employed to make my insult
drive him to his steel. But, Spanish blood
is hot, and, truth to tell, my tongue can cut and
thrust. Her eyes were on us at a <i>f&ecirc;te champ&ecirc;tre</i>
when, standing by his side, I spoke the words
that made him mine at midnight&mdash;&#8217;neath a
moon like this. There&#8217;s little left to tell. He
knew a Spanish trick or two, but, monsieur, he
was a boy! In the moonlight there his eyes
were so like hers I lost all pity&mdash;and&mdash;so&mdash;he
died.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then I vowed a candle to St. Christopher
and sailed across the sea. Breathe it not, monsieur&mdash;I
bore a letter from de Montespan to
Frontenac.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then cut your tongue out ere you tell the
tale,&#8221; exclaimed La Salle, gruffly. After a moment&#8217;s
silence he went on, more gently: &#8220;But,
Monsieur le Comte, I cannot understand the ease
of your escape. You&#8217;ve roused the anger of the
King, de Maintenon, the Jesuits, and Spain.
Such foes could crush an empire in a day.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;But you yourself, monsieur, have stood against
them all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; exclaimed La Salle, musingly. &#8220;You
may be right, my friend. I sometimes wonder
if my life is charmed. Whom can I trust, monsieur?
Allies false when the hour of danger
came, assassins at my bedside, and poison in my
food&mdash;all these I&#8217;ve known, monsieur. And still
I live.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two adventurers had arisen and were facing
each other in the moonlight. La Salle, tall,
commanding&mdash;a king by the divine right of a
dauntless soul&mdash;stood, with head uncovered, looking
down at the slender, graceful patrician confronting
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You strive for France, Sieur de la Salle,&#8221; exclaimed
de Sancerre, the mocking note gone from
his voice&mdash;&#8220;for the glory of dear France&mdash;and
France will not destroy you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For France!&#8221; repeated La Salle, solemnly.
&#8220;For France and for the Church! <i>Vive le
Roi!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Silently they turned and, mounting the hillock,
made their way toward the sleeping camp,
while the Mississippi rolled on beneath the moon
to tell a strange tale to the listening waters of
the gulf.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>IN WHICH DE SANCERRE IS CONFRONTED BY A<br />
MYSTERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> a statue done in bronze stood Chat&eacute;muc
before a hastily-constructed hut at the rear of
the log fort in which the rank and file of the explorers
lay sleeping. La Salle had chosen the
sentry as his special body-guard, for at many a
critical juncture in his long years of exploration&mdash;menaced
at all times, as he had been, by a
thousand lurking perils&mdash;the daring Frenchman
had tested the loyalty and courage of this stalwart
Mohican, who, for love of a white man, had
wandered many weary miles from his tribal hunting-grounds.</p>

<p>Within the rude but spacious hut over which
the phlegmatic Indian stood guard lay sleeping,
as La Salle and de Sancerre entered the enclosure,
two men who had found rest upon heaps
of leaves and grass, and whose strangely-contrasted
outlines, emphasized by the errant moonbeams
that penetrated the chinks between the
logs, called attention to the curious mixture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
unrelated nationalities of which La Salle&#8217;s expedition
was made up. In one corner of the hut
reclined the slender form of the Franciscan friar,
Zenobe Membr&eacute;. Upon his placid, smiling face&mdash;a
countenance suggestive of religious enthusiasm
even while he slept&mdash;rested a ray of silvery
light, as if the prayer that he had uttered ere
he fell asleep had transformed itself into a halo to
glorify his pillow through the night. His thin
hands were crossed upon his breast, and showed
white and transparent against the gray background
of his garb.</p>

<p>Within the shadows at an opposite corner of
the apartment lay the lithe, muscular figure of
a man whose costume made it difficult for the
observer to determine whether the wearer was a
foot-soldier from the Low Countries or a Canadian
<i>coureur de bois</i>. The truth was that Henri
de Tonti&#8217;s experiences as an Italian officer in the
Sicilian wars had left their impress upon his attire
as an explorer under de la Salle. As he
lay, fully dressed, in the moonlight that night
he might well have been a sculptor&#8217;s dream, representing
in his outlines the martial genius of
the Old World, bringing &#8220;not peace but a sword&#8221;
to the New. A bare hand rested lovingly upon the
cross-piece of his rapier, which he had unfastened
from his waist and tossed upon the dry grass of his
couch. His other hand was covered by a glove.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
tempting beds of leaves, La Salle and de Sancerre
stood side by side in the centre of the
hut for a moment, gazing thoughtfully at the
weird tableau that their slumbering comrades
made.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sword and crucifix!&#8221; whispered de Sancerre,
pointing from the soldier to the priest.
&#8220;Strange allies these, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But one without the other were in vain!
They serve together by the will of God. Good-night,
Monsieur le Comte.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How long de Sancerre had slept before he
was awakened by a light touch upon his shoulder
he never knew. It must have been a considerable
time, for, as he opened his reluctant
eyes, he saw that the moonlight no longer
gleamed in all quarters of the hut, but dimly illumined
only one corner thereof. Inured though
he was to perils of all kinds, the Count felt
a thrill of dismay as his eyes rested upon a hideous,
grinning face leering at him from the
shadows close at hand. He sat up hurriedly,
uttering no sound, but fumbling in the leaves
and grass for his rapier. A glance assured him
that his comrades had been undisturbed by the
intruder at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be not afraid, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; whispered a voice in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
broken Spanish. &#8220;The children of the moon
have naught to fear from us.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre, to whom Spanish was like a native
tongue, raised himself upon his elbow and
gazed searchingly at the misshapen hag who had
disturbed his sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;I crave your pardon,&#8221; he murmured, with
the air of a courtier addressing a coquette in the
Salon de Venus, while the mocking smile that
his face so often wore gleamed in the half-light.
&#8220;Then I am of the children of the moon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At night ye come from out the shadows of
the distant lands, ye white-faced offspring of your
Queen, the Moon. The Sun, our God, has told us
you would come. Be not afraid. We have rare
gifts for you&mdash;and loving hearts.&#8221;</p>

<p>The harsh, guttural voice in which the aged
crone spoke these gentle words added to the uncanny
effect of her wrinkled, time-marked face,
peering at the smiling Frenchman through the
gloom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bring you this,&#8221; she went on, still speaking
in a mongrel Spanish patois, which de Sancerre
found it difficult to interpret. &#8220;Remember what
I say. The children of the sun send greeting to
their brothers of the moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid upon the dried grass of his bed a piece
of white mulberry bark, upon which de Sancerre&#8217;s
eyes rested indifferently for an instant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
When he raised them again the hag had left his
side, and he saw her pushing her way through
an opening in the tree-limbs at the further end
of the hut. For an instant her diminutive body
stopped the gap in the wooden wall. Then, from
where he lay, the Frenchman could catch a
glimpse of moonbeams on the river through the
opening that she had made.</p>

<p>For a moment this strange visitation affected
de Sancerre unpleasantly. Surrounded, as their
little party was, by unknown tribes with whom
the wily Spaniards had had intercourse, the
words of the old crone, cordial though they had
been in their way, filled the Count with alarm.
Furthermore, the ease with which she had made
an undiscovered entrance to their hut emphasized
the disquiet that he had begun to feel. Thorough
soldier as he was, this seemingly harmless invasion
of his leader&#8217;s quarters became to his
mind a more menacing episode the more he
weighed it in all its bearings.</p>

<p>Rising noiselessly from his resting-place, de
Sancerre made his way between his sleeping
comrades to the entrance to the hut. Stepping
forth into the white night, he confronted Chat&eacute;muc,
who still stood motionless in the same spot
that he had occupied when La Salle and his
companion had returned from the river. The
Mohican, from long service with the explorer, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
acquired a practical knowledge of the French
tongue, but, as a general rule, he made use of it
only in monosyllables.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chat&eacute;muc,&#8221; said de Sancerre, sternly, &#8220;your
eyes are heavy with the moonlight or with sleep.
You keep indifferent guard. Did you not see
an aged witch who even now stood within the
hut and roused me from my sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>The tall Mohican gazed down upon the Frenchman
with keen, searching eyes, which glowed at
that moment with a fire that proved him innocent
either of treason or stupidity. His stern,
immobile face gave no indication of the astonishment
which the Frenchman&#8217;s accusation must
have caused him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing stirring but the river and
the leaves,&#8221; said Chat&eacute;muc, with grim emphasis,
turning his shapely head slowly to sweep the
landscape in all directions with eyes for which
the forest had no mysteries.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, my Chat&eacute;muc! You&#8217;re as proud
and stubborn as de Groot, the Hollander. But
follow me. I&#8217;ll show you a hole that proves
I dreamed no dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre, behind whom stalked the stately
Mohican, made his way hurriedly to the further
side of the hut. Pointing to an opening between
the logs, through which a small boy might have
crawled, the Count said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>&#8220;Behold, monsieur, the yawning chasm in your
reputation as a sentry! &#8217;Twould not admit an
army, but it might serve for a snake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chat&eacute;muc had fallen upon his knees, and was
examining the aperture and the trampled grass
which led to it. Presently he arose and turned
towards the Count.</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Small. Light.
Old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine woodcraft, Chat&eacute;muc! You read the
blazonry that crossed the drawbridge with great
skill&mdash;after the castle has been captured. But
let it pass. No harm&#8217;s been done, save that your
pride has had a fall. And so I leave you to
your watch again. If you loved me, Chat&eacute;muc,
you&#8217;d keep old women from my midnight couch.
I fear my sleep is lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stealing noiselessly past the motionless forms
of La Salle, the friar, and the Italian captain,
after his successful demonstration of Chat&eacute;muc&#8217;s
negligence as a sentinel, de Sancerre approached
his tumbled bed of leaves with weary step. A
feeling of depression, a sudden realization of the
horrid possibilities that his environment suggested,
a sensation of impotent rebellion at the
fate that had hurled him from the very centre
of seventeenth-century civilization into the rude
embrace of a horror-haunted wilderness, came
suddenly upon the vivacious Frenchman, mocking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
at his stoical views of life and making of the
satirical tendency of his mind a knife with which
to cut himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Nom de Dieu!</i>&#8221; he muttered, as he gazed
down upon the dry grass and leaves of his uninviting
couch, &#8220;these be fine lodgings for a Count
of Languedoc! At the worst, with Turenne,
there was always Versailles at our rear.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that instant his heavy eyes lighted upon
the slip of white bark which his recent caller had
left with him as a token of good-will. De Sancerre
bent down and, grasping the seemingly
meaningless gift, gazed at it inquiringly. To
his amazement, he made out in the darkness
what seemed to him to be a bit of writing,
scratched with a pointed instrument upon this
fragment from a mulberry bush. Hastily, stealthily,
making his way to the opening through
which the donor of the gift had forced her exit,
the Count leaned forward, and in the moonlight
read, with wondering eyes, the name:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Julia de Aquilar</i></p>

<p>It was the name of the woman for love of
whom he had killed a Spaniard and lost his native
land. Instantly his mind harked back to the
confession that, but an hour or so before, he had
poured into the ears of Sieur de la Salle. Had
an eavesdropper overheard his words, and, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
spirit of mischief, sought to tease him by a trick?
He rejected the supposition at once, for the conviction
came upon him, increasing a thousandfold
the consternation which he felt, that he had deliberately
refrained from mentioning the name
of his inamorata to La Salle.</p>

<p>De Sancerre drew himself erect and stood motionless
for a moment, the most amazed and
startled being in all the strange new world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>IN WHICH A MAIDEN SHOWS HER HEART</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sieur de la Salle&#8217;s</span> temporary stockade had
been erected upon the western bank of the great
river, and his followers had received with delight
the report that their leader had decided to
indulge in a few days of recuperation before continuing
his journey to the gulf. After weeks of
labor at the paddles, the canoemen were in sore
need of rest. The party consisted of twenty-three
Frenchmen, eighteen Indians&mdash;Abenakis
and Mohicans&mdash;ten squaws, and three pappooses.
Discontent and even open grumbling had already
developed in this incongruous assemblage, and it
was only the stern, imperious personality of de
la Salle that had saved the expedition from falling
asunder through the inherent antagonisms of
the elements of which it was composed.</p>

<p>But upon the morning following the Count de
Sancerre&#8217;s receipt of an inexplicable gift from
the children of the sun there reigned an air of
gayety in the camp. Provisions were plentiful,
the terminus of the exploration, it was rumored,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
was near at hand, and, for the next few days, at
least, no exhausting task, no menacing danger
seemed likely to annoy the adventurers. The
glories of early spring upon the lower Mississippi
met their wondering and grateful eyes. In his
delight the Frenchman carolled forth a <i>chanson</i>
to greet the rising sun, while his phlegmatic
comrade, the native American, grunted with satisfaction
as he reclined upon the long grass and
appeared to muse indolently upon the strange
vivacity of the men from over-sea.</p>

<p>Shortly after dawn de Sancerre, pale, heavy-eyed,
restless, weary of his vain efforts to gain a
dreamless sleep, had wandered away from the
camp and thrown himself listlessly down upon
the gently sloping shore of the river, across
whose ripples flashed the gleaming arrows of
the April sun. As he lay there, reclining against
a slender tree-trunk, the last few hours seemed
to him to have been a long nightmare, through
which the mocking black eyes of a woman of
wondrous beauty had taunted him for his helplessness.</p>

<p>As de Sancerre, refreshed by the cool breeze
that chased the sunbeams across the flood, recalled
every detail of his recent adventure, he
found himself confronted not only by a mystery,
but by a choice between two courses of action
which must be made at once. Should he tell his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
comrades of the strange episode that had disturbed
his rest, or should he keep the secret to
himself, trusting to Chat&eacute;muc&#8217;s pride and reticence
to repress the story of the night? In a
certain sense he was under obligations to de la
Salle to keep him informed of every happening
which, even remotely, might affect the welfare
of the expedition. On the other hand, there was
that in his leader&#8217;s personality which caused de
Sancerre to hesitate before telling him a tale
which, he reflected, would sound like the ravings
of a lunatic. He could picture the cold, disdainful
glance in de la Salle&#8217;s searching eye ere he
turned upon his heel with the curt remark that
the Count de Sancerre&#8217;s dreams should test the
friar&#8217;s skill.</p>

<p>To the Count, thus vexed by a most disturbing
problem, came Katonah, sister of Chat&eacute;muc, the
only Indian maiden in Sieur de la Salle&#8217;s strangely-assorted
suite. With the most punctilious
courtesy de Sancerre sprang erect, removed from
his head his travel-worn but still picturesque
bonnet, and, making a sweeping bow, pointed to
the grass-grown seat that he had just vacated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle Katonah, I bid you welcome!
I was dreaming, <i>petite</i>, of the land across the
sea. Your eyes and smile shall change my
mood again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian girl gazed at the Frenchman with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
dark, fearless eyes, in which there gleamed a
light that told the courtier a tale he had no
wish to learn. Not that the Count was better
than his age, more scrupulous than the pleasure-loving
court in which his youth had been passed,
but in the freer, nobler atmosphere of this brave
New World, and in the companionship of men
striving in the midst of peril to do great deeds,
all that was most admirable in de Sancerre&#8217;s
character had been born anew, and, to his own
amazement, he had learned that his views of life
had undergone a change, that there had grown
up something in his soul which gave the lie to
his scoffing tongue, still from habit the tongue of
a <i>mondain</i> fashioned in an evil school.</p>

<p>Katonah, reclining against the tree and gazing
upward at the Frenchman, formed a deep-toned
picture becoming to that land of hazy sunlight,
drowzy zephyrs, and opening flowers, bright-hued
and redolent of spring. Her dark eyes,
clear-cut features, and white, even teeth, her
slender, supple limbs, satisfied even the exacting
eye of a man who had looked with admiration
upon La Valli&egrave;re, de Montespan, de Maintenon.</p>

<p>&#8220;The land across the sea!&#8221; exclaimed Katonah,
waving a slender, well-turned hand toward the
opposite shore of the great river. &#8220;You would
go back to it?&#8221; She had learned the French
tongue from her brother, Chat&eacute;muc.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Her eloquent eyes rested questioningly upon
the pallid, symmetrical face of de Sancerre.</p>

<p>The barbaric directness of her question brought
a smile to the Frenchman&#8217;s lips as he threw
himself down by her side and took her hand in
his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mayhap some day I shall go back, <i>ma petite</i>.
But at this moment I have no wish to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre was looking at Katonah, but in
his mind was the picture of a scrap of white
bark upon which had been scrawled the name of
the only woman his heart had ever loved. Perhaps
Katonah weighed his words at their real
worth, for she withdrew her hand from his,
while her gentle eyes rested mournfully upon
the mighty river upon whose bosom she had
learned the joy and sorrow of a hopeless love.</p>

<p>De Sancerre, whose delicately-moulded face,
graceful figure, ready wit, and quick perceptions,
added to high birth and a reputation for physical
courage, had made him a favorite at a voluptuous
court, felt a mixture of self-satisfaction and annoyance
at the unsought homage that he had
won from this handsome savage. No coquette
at Versailles could have put into artful words
the flattery that Katonah gave him by a glance.
But de Sancerre realized that, under existing
circumstances, her devotion to him might involve
them both in serious peril. Her brother, Chat&eacute;muc,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
was a sentry whose eyes and ears would
not always be blind and deaf to what was stirring
besides the river and the leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Katonah,&#8221; said the Count, presently, &#8220;let me
tell you why I may never go back to the land
beyond the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian girl gazed up at him with earnest
attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the great wigwam of the king who rules
all kings there came a maiden from a distant
land. Her eyes were like the night, her hair the
color of a raven&#8217;s wing.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre met Katonah&#8217;s eyes and remained
silent for a time. There was something in her
glance that chilled him for the moment with an
inexplicable foreboding. Annoyed at his weakness,
he went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;All men loved her, <i>ma petite</i>, and so it was
not strange that I&mdash; <i>Mais n&#8217;importe.</i> Among
the braves, Katonah, who followed in her train
was a youth with evil eye, a black, soft-footed,
proud, and boastful man, to whom her word was
sworn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You killed him, then,&#8221; said Katonah, with
conviction.</p>

<p>De Sancerre started nervously and gazed
around him searchingly. There was an uncanny
precipitancy in Katonah&#8217;s mental methods
which affected him unpleasantly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he acknowledged. &#8220;I killed him,
Katonah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the maiden with the raven hair? You
carried her away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Katonah. I came across the sea and
left her there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes of the Mohican wore a puzzled expression
as she tried to read his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand,&#8221; she murmured, presently.</p>

<p>De Sancerre remained silent for a while. He
realized that, with the limited vocabulary at his
disposal, he could not make the Indian girl comprehend
the exigencies which, in a civilized land,
might arise to drive a lover from his loved one&#8217;s
side. The mind of the savage maiden was unfitted
to grasp those finer distinctions which
made the habits and customs at Versailles so
superior to the methods and manners prevailing
among her Mohican kindred. Presently the expatriated
courtier said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Katonah, let me tell you a strange tale.
Your brother kept guard last night between the
river and our hut. But while we slept an aged
woman crept up beside my bed and gave me this.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre removed from his breast the piece
of mulberry bark upon which rested the name of
Julia de Aquilar. Katonah gazed at the writing
awe-struck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;It is the name,&#8221; said the Frenchman, in answer
to her glance, &#8220;of the woman with the raven
hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian girl, with marvellous grace and
agility, sprang to her feet. Motionless she stood
for a moment looking down at de Sancerre.</p>

<p>&#8220;She followed you across the sea?&#8221; she asked,
in a dull, passionless voice.</p>

<p>De Sancerre smiled as he slipped the bark
into his doublet and rose to a standing posture.</p>

<p>&#8220;That could not be, Katonah,&#8221; he said, lightly.
&#8220;I think some wizard, making medicine,
has read her name upon my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>More he might have said, but at that instant
Chat&eacute;muc, with stormy brow, stood beside them.
Not glancing at the Frenchman, his angry gaze
rested upon the shrinking figure of Katonah.
With an imperious gesture he pointed towards
the camp, and, as the girl hurried away in obedience
to her brother&#8217;s silent behest, de Sancerre
threw himself wearily upon the bank, a mocking
light gleaming in his eyes as he turned and
watched the retreating Mohicans until they were
lost to sight behind the osier-trees.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>IN WHICH DE LA SALLE REACHES A FATEFUL<br />
DECISION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I have</span> heard it said that the good Father le
Jeune, the Jesuit, not speaking Algonquin, was
obliged to expound the mysteries of the faith to
the Montagnais through the aid of a blasphemous
backslider, far gone in liquor. This tool of Satan
put vile words into the mouth of the Jesuit,
so that the Montagnais laughed mockingly while
le Jeune fondly thought that he was explaining
to them the doctrine of the Trinity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henri de Tonti, Zenobe Membr&eacute;, and Sieur de
la Salle had joined the Count de Sancerre, after
the departure of Chat&eacute;muc and Katonah, and
the quartet had formed itself for the time being
into a council, to answer at once an insistent and
momentous question. Two white-robed envoys,
carrying a disk of burnished copper to represent
the sun, had entered La Salle&#8217;s hut an hour before
this, bringing to him an invitation to visit,
with his followers, the city of their chief. Henri
de Tonti, enthusiastic lay proselyter though he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
was, had taken the ground that an expedition to
the haunts of the sun-worshippers would result
in nothing more valuable than a waste of time
and energy, while it might involve the party in
unforeseen dangers. To check the enthusiasm
of the Franciscan friar, who longed to convert
these friendly idolaters to the true faith, de
Tonti had just been calling the attention of the
council to the difficulties besetting a missionary
who attempted to explain the teachings of
Mother Church in a tongue with which he was
not thoroughly conversant.</p>

<p>The slender, white-faced friar, whose great
physical endurance was suggested by nothing in
his outward seeming but the clear, steady gleam
in his large gray eyes, turned, rather impatiently,
from the Italian adventurer and put forth an
appealing palm towards Sieur de la Salle, who lay
at full length upon the bank, his head resting
upon his upturned hand, as he listened attentively
to the debate between the soldier and the
priest.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is much efficacy in signs, monsieur,&#8221;
exclaimed Membr&eacute;, with fervor. &#8220;Could I have
led a thousand redmen to a knowledge of the
truth had I always waited for an alien tongue?
When all seemed lost, when their ears were
deaf, when my prayers and hymns were but the
feeble strivings of a voice they would not heed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
has come a miracle, vouchsafed by Jesus Christ,
and howling savages have fallen prone in penitence
before the cross. I ask not much of you,
monsieur, but in the name of Mother Church I
crave an escort to these children of the sun. To
pass them by, to leave them hopeless in their
blind idolatry, to say no word to bring them to
the faith&mdash;Mother of God, but this would be a
sin!&#8221;</p>

<p>The delicate face of the Franciscan glowed
with the fervor of his soul. He had drawn himself
up to his full height, and his rich, penetrating
voice echoed weirdly across the gleaming
waters of the flood.</p>

<p>De la Salle put up his hand with a gesture
seemingly intended to calm the exuberance of
the devoted priest. Turning to de Sancerre,
who was seated on his right, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What think you, Monsieur le Comte? Shall
we risk a visit to these children of the sun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mais oui, monsieur.</i> There is no other
course. If they should take offence at our neglect&mdash;<i>ma
foi</i>, it might go hard with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>A scornful smile played across de Tonti&#8217;s
scarred and rugged face. He was annoyed at
his failure to prevent the delay which this apparently
useless visit to a pagan tribe would engender.
De Sancerre observed the satirical expression
upon the Italian&#8217;s countenance, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
wisely refrained from giving voice to the anger
which he felt at the sight. Between de Tonti
and de Sancerre a national antagonism had been
intensified by the jealousy existing between them
regarding the attitude of their leader. The evident
fondness shown by de la Salle for the companionship
of the itinerant French nobleman
had displeased the Italian veteran, whose long
years of devotion to the explorer&#8217;s service had
begotten a claim to special consideration. In
more highly civilized surroundings the friction
between de Tonti and de Sancerre would long
ago have found relief in bloodshed. One striking
difference between Versailles and the wilderness
lay in the fact that in the latter greater
provocation was needed to impel men to run
each other through with steel than in the parks
in which gay courtiers insulted one another with
soft words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Furthermore, monsieur,&#8221; went on de Sancerre,
observing that his words had not impelled
de la Salle to come to an immediate decision regarding
the question at issue&mdash;&#8220;furthermore,
there may be a way to find an interpreter through
whom these lost idolaters shall learn the teachings
of our faith.&#8221; If there sounded a note of
insincerity in the Frenchman&#8217;s voice, none marked
it save de Tonti, whose smile was always satirical
when de Sancerre touched upon the Church.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;Your words, Monsieur le Comte, mean much
or nothing. Explain yourself,&#8221; said de la Salle,
coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice at the further end of yonder
hut a hole through which a good-sized dog might
crawl?&#8221; asked de Sancerre, impressively, arising
and pointing toward the camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sieur de la Salle has eyes for everything,
Monsieur le Comte,&#8221; remarked de Tonti, tauntingly.</p>

<p>Paying no attention to his rival, de Sancerre
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Through that hole last night there crept into
the hut an aged hag, who, coming to my side,
gave us a welcome from the children of the sun.
They call us&mdash;as you know&mdash;the children of the
moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>De la Salle, calm, phlegmatic, but ever on the
alert, gazed searchingly at the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your tale is somewhat late, monsieur,&#8221; he
remarked, meaningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feared the gossip of an idle camp,&#8221; said
de Sancerre, lightly, carelessly tossing a pebble
into the rippling waters at his feet. &#8220;The matter&#8217;s
not of moment but for this: the old crone
spoke a Spanish <i>patois</i>, hard to understand, but
not impossible. Her tongue, I think, might serve
our friar well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Spanish <i>patois</i>?&#8221; repeated de la Salle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
musingly. &#8220;&#8217;Tis well you spoke of this, Monsieur
le Comte. I told the keen-eyed Colbert that
there was no time to lose. Below, around us lie
the lands of gold, and stretched across them rests
the arm of Spain. The time has come when we
must lop it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>De la Salle had arisen and, with his hand upon
the hilt of his sword, gazed toward the waters
which flowed toward a Spanish sea. He looked,
for the moment, the very incarnation of the martial
spirit of an adventurous age, bidding defiance
to a mighty foe. Suddenly he turned and eyed
his followers sternly. In a voice which admitted
of no reply, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;De Tonti, de Sancerre, and Membr&eacute;, prepare
to set out at once to these people of the sun.
I&#8217;ll give you presents for their chiefs and wives.
Send Chat&eacute;muc to me. He shall go with you,
and his sister&mdash;Katonah, is it not? She&#8217;ll find
the woman with the Spanish tongue where you,
as men, might fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre, springing to
his feet, &#8220;there may be peril for the girl in this.
&#8217;Tis best we go alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am amazed, Monsieur le Comte,&#8221; remarked
La Salle, sternly. &#8220;Obey my orders! &#8217;Tis
not for you to question what I plan. Whatever
comes of this, the blame shall rest with
me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>De Tonti, Membr&eacute;, and de Sancerre had turned
to make their way hurriedly back to the camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;De Sancerre,&#8221; called La Salle, ere they had
gone beyond ear-shot. The French nobleman
returned hurriedly to his leader&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no danger to Katonah in all this,&#8221;
said La Salle, meaningly, his eyes reading de
Sancerre&#8217;s face. &#8220;No harm can come to her, for
Chat&eacute;muc is ever by her side. No nobleman in
Spain or France is prouder, de Sancerre, than
Chat&eacute;muc. You understand me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, I am not dull, monsieur!&#8221; exclaimed
the Count, a note of anger in his voice. Then
he turned on his heel and strode rapidly toward
the camp.</p>

<small>IN WHICH A DAUGHTER GRANTS A FATHER&#8217;S WISH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Late</span> in the afternoon of a day in April, just
one year before the date of the occurrences recorded
in the foregoing chapters of this tale, Don
Rodrigo de Aquilar, statesman, soldier, scholar,
devout Catholic, sat at a curiously-carved table in
the library of his ancestral house in the street of
Las Palmas, Seville. His gray hair and pointed
beard, his keen, dark eyes and lofty brow, the
simple elegance of his attire, and the artistic
luxury of his surroundings combined to form a
striking picture in the half-lights of the waning
day. Upon the table before him lay pompous
tomes, quaint old manuscripts, and several crude
maps and charts.</p>

<p>Copies of the letters of Menendez to Philip II.
of Spain, made by Don Rodrigo in the archives
of Seville; a transcript of the bull &#8220;by the authority
whereof Pope Alexander, the sixth of
that name, gave and granted to the Kings of
Castile and their successors the regions and
islands found in the west ocean sea by the navigations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
of the Spaniards:&#8221; a reproduction of a
map of the western world, dedicated to Sir Philip
Sidney by Michael Lok; a volume entitled <i>Hakluyt&#8217;s
Divers Voyages</i>, hot with hatred of the
Spanish, and other misleading data concerning a
misunderstood continent confronted the Castilian
aristocrat, and by their united efforts cast upon
him a spell which had brought to his thin cheeks
a hectic flush, and to his haughty lips lines of
determination.</p>

<p>It was, however, with a much later manuscript
than any one of those above mentioned that Don
Rodrigo was engaged at the moment of which
we write. Bending eagerly forward from a
quaintly-cut, high-backed chair, the aged Spaniard
was scanning attentively a parchment upon
which a recent explorer, with artistic tendencies,
had inscribed a pictorial outline of his discoveries.
Ports, harbors, islands, and rivers competed for
the attention of the observer with rudely outlined
birds, beasts, and fishes. Indians feasting and
dancing, Indians flogged by priests. Indians burning
alive for heresy, gave grim testimony to the
fact that the eccentric cartographer had witnessed
sympathetically the saving of souls in the
New World. It was not upon these, however,
nor upon the chameleon with two legs confronting
a bat-winged griffin having the tail of an alligator&mdash;a
weird product, according to the map-maker,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
of Mexico&mdash;that Don Rodrigo de Aquilar
was squandering the retreating light of day.
His eyes and mind rested upon a sketch representing
a group of Indians working silver
mines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Methinks, Juan, the venture&#8217;s worth the risk.
Were it not for Do&ntilde;a Julia, I&#8217;d slip my anchor
of old age and sail across the sea. I have no mind
to place the King&#8217;s gift in an agent&#8217;s hands, to
let him rob the Mexicans and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don Rodrigo had leaned back in his chair, and
was gazing across the disordered table at a pale,
dark-eyed youth, attired in black velvet, whose
thin, nervous hand had been making a copy of
letters-patent from Charles of Spain to his
Majesty&#8217;s &#8220;dear beloved son in Christ, Don Rodrigo
de Aquilar.&#8221; Juan Rodriquez, secretary to
Don Rodrigo, was a lineal descendant of a <i>marinero</i>
of Seville who had returned safely to his
native city after circumnavigating the globe with
Magellan. Of this same <i>marinero</i> it had been
written that he was &#8220;energetic, courageous, but
marvellous unprincipled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard Do&ntilde;a Julia say, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; remarked
Juan in a softly modulated voice&mdash;&#8220;I
have heard her say, within the last few days,
that she would be glad to see those strange
lands over-sea, where palaces are made of gold
and pearls grow upon the trees.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>A grim smile played across the haughty countenance
of the old statesman.</p>

<p>&#8220;An idle whim begot of idle tales, young man!
But were I sure that sufferings and danger would
not beset our ship, I&#8217;d take the girl and look
upon my grant before I die. &#8217;Twill be her heritage
at last. But, look you, Juan! These blind
cartographers have dealt in fancies tempting
men to death. Somewhere beneath the soil of
yonder fatal land lie my two sons&mdash;and in my
death a famous name must die. And I am old.
They&#8217;d say at court, should I set sail from here,
that his Majesty&#8217;s rich gifts had made me mad
at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence at the table for a time. Don
Rodrigo reclined in his chair and watched the
changing lights and shadows of the waning day
as they emphasized the sombre beauty of the
room. Presently he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made the footings, Juan? A hundred
thousand ducats will cover everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And leave a handsome margin, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; answered
the secretary, referring to a parchment
upon which daintily-executed rows of figures had
been inscribed. &#8220;As times go, se&ntilde;or, the vessel
costs you but a song.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don Rodrigo eyed Juan Rodriquez searchingly.
His secretary&#8217;s apparent eagerness for the
venture mystified him. Diplomatist, educated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
in a crafty school, the old Spaniard had never
lost sight of the advantages to be gained at times
by frank directness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are urging me to take this step, Juan.
Let me ask you why?&#8221;</p>

<p>The pale face of the youth had turned yellow
in the twilight. His dark, shifty eyes refused to
meet his master&#8217;s insistent gaze. His thin hand
drummed nervously on the dry, rattling parchment
in front of him as he said, with an attempt
at candor which did not ring true:</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe, se&ntilde;or, that it would be well for
Do&ntilde;a Julia, and for you, to leave Seville for a
time. She mourns Don Josef&mdash;does she not?
And you, Don Rodrigo, have won a triumph
in diplomacy that frees you for a while from
public life. The voyage now is not so fraught
with danger as of old, nor is there peril when
you reach New Spain. More than one fair lady
of Seville has been across and back for love of
Mother Church. And, as I said, the marvels of
the sea might serve to turn your daughter&#8217;s
mind from thoughts of her betrothed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don Rodrigo gazed earnestly at the eager face
of his secretary.</p>

<p>&#8220;You believe, then, Juan, that Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s
heart was broken when Don Josef fell, run
through by the Frenchman&#8217;s sword? You think
she loved him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>&#8220;Nay, se&ntilde;or, such thoughts are not for me,&#8221;
answered Juan, in a voice that resembled the
purring of a cat. &#8220;But this I see&mdash;that since you
returned from France her eyes are heavy and
her cheeks are pale. The songs she used to sing
we hear no more. She&#8217;s fading like a flower
which craves the sun. Give her, se&ntilde;or, new
aims, new scenes, the splendors of the sea, the
marvels of New Spain, and once again her eyes
and smile will be as sunny as they were of old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wise beyond your years, young man,&#8221;
remarked the old diplomat, playfully. &#8220;Mayhap,
my Juan, you know a charm to make me
young again. Or perhaps you can find the
island of Bimini and the fountain of eternal
youth which bold de Leon sought. But, hark,
I hear her step! We&#8217;ll lay the venture, in all its
bare simplicity, before her, and do as she decides.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Don Rodrigo ceased speaking there entered
the library a dark-haired, large-eyed, graceful
girl, who glided from the shadows of the twilight
toward the centre of the room, and stood
motionless at the lower end of the long table.
A belated sunbeam, stealing through the distant
window, caressed her face for a moment, upon
which a sad smile rested as her eyes met her
father&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;You disobey his Majesty&#8217;s behest, Don Rodrigo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
de Aquilar!&#8221; she exclaimed, playfully, pointing
toward the books and maps before her. &#8220;Did
not the King command you to take a well-earned
rest, my father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But his Majesty has never ordered me to sit
here and die,&#8221; remarked Don Rodrigo, emphatically.
&#8220;Be seated, Julia. You come to us at a
most opportune moment. For my services in
France his Majesty has granted me fair lands
across the sea. Mines rich in silver belong to
me by virtue of this seal. The question is, my
daughter, will you go with me to view my province
in New Spain?&#8221;</p>

<p>Juan Rodriquez, who had arisen upon Do&ntilde;a
Julia&#8217;s entrance, stood watching the girl with
stealthy eyes, in which there gleamed a light not
there before. There was silence in the room for a
moment. Then Julia, looking Don Rodrigo fearlessly
in the face, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go with you gladly, father. Seville has
stifled me. But place no faith upon my changing
whims. If we&#8217;re to go, then let us sail at
once.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>IN WHICH JUAN RODRIQUEZ UNDERGOES AN UNPLEASANT<br />
HALF-HOUR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1681 the fickle Guadalquivir still
pursued a liberal policy toward Seville and
vouchsafed sufficient water to that port to enable
sea-going vessels to begin or end their voyages
within sight of the Alcazar. Later on, the
Spanish sailors were forced, by the treachery
of the famous river, to abandon Seville and betake
themselves to Cadiz for an ocean harborage.</p>

<p>At the time, however, at which Don Rodrigo
de Aquilar fitted out the <i>Concepcion</i>&mdash;a high-pooped
vessel of ninety tons burden&mdash;for his
voyage to the silver mines bestowed upon him
by Charles II. of Spain, the harbor at Seville
enabled the aged diplomat to equip his ship
without leaving his library. By giving his orders
to his secretary, Juan Rodriquez, who carried
them to Gomez Hernandez, captain of the
<i>Concepcion</i>, Don Rodrigo was relieved of the
friction which in those days frequently soured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
an adventurer&#8217;s disposition even before he had
put to sea.</p>

<p>The necessity for haste, lest the veering winds
of Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s fickle fancy should at the last
moment balk her father&#8217;s enterprise, had been
impressed upon Juan Rodriquez, who needed no
hint from Don Rodrigo to make him a gadfly
to the captain of the <i>Concepcion</i>. Long before
he weighed anchor, Gomez Hernandez had sworn
by his favorite saint that if the opportunity ever
came to him to put the white-faced, soft-voiced
secretary into irons, he would show him no pity.
That the perilous voyage before them might furnish
him with the means for punishing Juan&#8217;s
insolence the captain well knew. Let the <i>Concepcion</i>
toss the Canaries well astern, and for
many weeks Gomez Hernandez would be autocrat
in a little kingdom of his own.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s cabin was, as it were, the hawser
which held the clumsy little ship to her moorings.
A stuffy room between decks, it seemed
cruel to ask a maiden used to the luxury of
Seville, Madrid and Paris to spend weeks within
its irritating confines. Don Rodrigo had devoted
great energy and ingenuity to the task of
making his daughter&#8217;s quarters aboard ship less
repulsive than they had at first seemed. Rugs
from the Orient, a hammock made of padded
silk, jars of sweetmeats from Turkey, a priceless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
oil-painting of the Virgin Mary, and other
quaintly contrasted offshoots of a fond father&#8217;s
anxious care combined to make Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s
cabin a compartment whose luxury was ludicrous
and whose discomfort was pathetic.</p>

<p>Had Don Rodrigo de Aquilar better understood
the peculiarities of his daughter&#8217;s disposition,
he would have spent less time in making
of her cabin a medi&aelig;val curiosity-shop, and
would have weighed anchor a week sooner than
he did&mdash;thus gaining a span of time which would
have begotten across the sea a radical difference
in the outcome of his expedition. Something of
this found its way into the mind of the aged
Spaniard after the <i>Concepcion</i> had cleared the
mouth of the Guadalquivir and was standing
out to sea. Beside him upon the poop-deck stood
Julia, her dark eyes gleaming with excitement
as they swept the tumbling sea or glanced upward
at the bulging sails which drove the awkward
craft haltingly across the deep. She had
paid little or no attention to the cabin which had
taxed Don Rodrigo&#8217;s ingenuity, Juan&#8217;s patience,
and Captain Hernandez&#8217;s temper for a month; but
the flush in her cheeks and the smile upon
her lips, as she watched the waters sweeping
the Old World away from her, gladdened her
father&#8217;s heart as he scanned her changing face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sea is kind to us. See yonder rainbow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
&#8217;gainst the purple east! An omen such as that
is worth a candle to St. Christopher.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soft, insistent voice of Juan Rodriquez
broke in upon the musings of the grandee and
his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not so strange the saints should wish us
well,&#8221; remarked Don Rodrigo, removing a black
velvet cap from his head to let the sea-wind play
with his white locks. &#8220;We go to serve the work
of Mother Church. To tell the heathen of Mary
and her Son, to raise the cross where blood-soaked
idols stand, to fight the devil with the
Book and prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, then&mdash;to work the mines,&#8221; put in Juan
gently.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia turned quickly and flashed an angry
glance at the soft-tongued secretary. She
had noticed, with annoyance, a change in Juan&#8217;s
manner since the ship had steered for the open
sea. In a way that defied explanation in words,
the young man had carried himself for the
past few hours as if, upon the deck of a ship, he
had found himself upon an equality with his
master. There was an elusive sarcasm in his
words at times, a defiant gleam in his restless
eyes, a mocking note in his voice, which the girl
noted with an inexplicable feeling of foreboding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye&mdash;to work the mines,&#8221; repeated Don
Rodrigo, unsuspiciously. &#8220;Why not? &#8217;Tis nigh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
two centuries since treasures from New Spain
came over-sea. And for their paltry gold we&#8217;ve
given them the cross. For every ducat gained
by Spain, a soul&#8217;s been won for heaven. Harsh
measures with the stubborn&mdash;these, of course.
&#8217;Tis thus the Church must win its way on earth.
The fight is not yet done. Upon the border of
the lands I own the good Dominicans have built
a mission-house. On you, my daughter, will devolve
the task to raise a great cathedral where the
friars dwell. I&#8217;ll dig the silver from the ground
for you, and mayhap from my place in paradise
the saints will give me eyes to see the glory of
your deeds. May Mother Mary will it so!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man&#8217;s eyes were upturned in fervor
toward the changing glories of the evening sky.
The excitement of the embarkation, the enlivening
influence of the stiff, salt breeze, and the
mysterious promises held out to him by that seductive
West toward which his vessel plunged
had stirred the blood in the aged Spaniard&#8217;s veins,
and emphasized at the same moment both his
religious enthusiasm and his earthly ambitions.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia was on the point of commenting
upon her father&#8217;s words when there sprang
to the deck from below a slender, active man
who, ashore, would have looked like a sailor, but
aboard ship resembled a soldier. Gomez Hernandez,
captain of the <i>Concepcion</i>, was the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
incarnation of that dauntless spirit which had,
within the lapse of two centuries, carried the
arms of Castile and Aragon to the farthest quarters
of an astonished globe. Bright, dark eyes,
a cruel mouth, a small, agile, muscular frame,
and a manner proud or cringing as occasion dictated,
combined to make of Gomez Hernandez a
typical Spanish seaman of the seventeenth century.
Saluting Don Rodrigo de Aquilar respectfully
the captain said:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I trouble you, se&ntilde;or, to join me in my
cabin for a while? I have matters to lay before
you which brook no delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hernandez&#8217;s words were addressed to the diplomat,
but his piercing eyes rested as he spoke
upon the face of Juan Rodriquez. The secretary,
even paler than his wont was, gazed across
the sea toward the horizon from which the
shades of night had begun to creep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Await me here, Julia,&#8221; said Don Rodrigo,
cheerfully, turning to follow the captain to the
lower deck. &#8220;I will return to you at once. Lead
on, my captain. You&#8217;ll find I am not mutinous,
no matter what you ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another moment Do&ntilde;a Julia and Juan Rodriquez
stood alone upon the poop. The secretary
turned from his contemplation of the sea and his
restless eyes fell full upon the disturbed face of
the girl, a face of marvellous beauty in the half-lights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
of the fading day. There was silence between
them for a time. The creaking of timbers,
the complaining of the cordage, the angry splash
of the disturbed sea, and from the bow the subdued
notes of an evening hymn, sung by devout
sailors, reached their ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; said Juan, moving toward Do&ntilde;a
Julia, &#8220;I have much to say to you&mdash;and there
is little time. If my words to you should seem
abrupt, the blame lies with my tongue, not with
my heart. If that could speak, you&#8217;d find me
eloquent indeed. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>With an imperious gesture, Do&ntilde;a Julia checked
his speech. Her symmetrical, somewhat voluptuous,
mouth was curved at that moment in a
smile of disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spare me&mdash;and spare yourself, Juan Rodriquez,&#8221;
she said, coldly, turning her back to the
sea and facing squarely the youth, whose eyes
met hers with a glance of crafty defiance not
unmingled with an admiration that filled her
with loathing. &#8220;You say more only at your peril.
I&#8217;ll forgive you your presumption&mdash;once. But
take good heed of what I say. If you address me
in such words again, it shall go hard with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A grayish pallor overspread Juan&#8217;s face in the
twilight. A cruel smile played across his thin
lips, and his hand grasped a railing at his side as
if it would crush the stubborn wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_046.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;THE CAPTAIN HURLED HIM DOWN UPON THE DECK&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;You threaten me, Do&ntilde;a Julia de Aquilar,&#8221;
he murmured, showing his teeth in an evil smile.
&#8220;You know not what you do. See how our ship
is driving toward the murky blackness of the
West. Think you I shall be powerless beyond?
I say to you, se&ntilde;ora, that you, your father, and
all you hold most dear, are in the grasp of Juan
Rodriquez&mdash;your servant in Seville, your master
in New Spain.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had seized the girl&#8217;s wrist and was gazing
into her white face with vindictive, hungry eyes.
She wrenched her arm free from his repellent
grasp, and, drawing herself up to her full height,
gazed haughtily at the boastful youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What mad fancies there may be in your
mind, Juan Rodriquez, I cannot guess. But this
I know: if I should breathe a word of what
you&#8217;ve said into my father&#8217;s ears, you&#8217;d lie a
prisoner between the decks. And he shall know
of this, unless you swear to me to leave me to myself,
to speak no word to me, to keep your eyes
from off my face, my name from off your lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>The threatening smile upon Juan&#8217;s mobile face
had changed to a spiteful grin while the girl was
speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your love for Don Rodrigo would be weak,
indeed, should you, se&ntilde;ora, speak a word of this.
I tell you, Do&ntilde;a Julia, your father&#8217;s in my grasp.
I&#8217;ll show him mercy&mdash;but I make my terms with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
you. &#8217;Tis no mad fancy, nor an idle boast,&#8221; went
on Juan, making a significant gesture toward
the slashed velvet upon his breast, &#8220;which you
have heard from me. I know my power. If
you are wise, you&#8217;ll take my word for this.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a calm, convincing note in Juan&#8217;s
voice that froze the rising anger in Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s
veins. She knew the crafty nature of the man
too well to believe that he would thus threaten
her unless he had gained possession of some
weapon for the working of great mischief. In
mute dismay she stood for a moment gazing
helplessly at the gray, grim waters which seemed
to yawn in hunger for the tossing ship. Suddenly
she felt an arm around her waist, and turning
quickly found the flushed face of the youth
pressed close to hers. An exclamation of mingled
disgust, anger, and fear escaped her.</p>

<p>At that instant the strong, nervous hand of
Gomez Hernandez seized Juan Rodriquez by the
neck. With an ease which his slight figure rendered
marvellous, the captain twisted the youth
like a plaything in his grasp, and then hurled
him, full length, prone upon the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I crave your pardon, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; said Hernandez,
with cool politeness, bowing low to Do&ntilde;a
Julia, &#8220;but Don Rodrigo requests your presence
in his cabin.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>IN WHICH JUAN RODRIQUEZ TAKES HIS REVENGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> voyage of the <i>Concepcion</i>, thus inauspiciously
begun, continued with fair weather upon
the sea and squalls threatening aboard the ship.
Do&ntilde;a Julia spent much time in her oddly-equipped
cabin; Don Rodrigo, impatient of delay, fretted
at the tedium of the passage and paced the poop
restlessly for hours at a time. Between Juan
Rodriquez and Captain Hernandez a sullen truce
was maintained for several weeks succeeding the
incident recorded at the end of the foregoing
chapter. But Juan had neither forgotten nor
forgiven the insult which he had received at the
hands of the relentless navigator. He awaited,
with the patience of a crafty schemer, an opportunity
to avenge himself upon the man who had
turned his melodramatic declaration of love into
an undignified farce.</p>

<p>A Carmelite friar, who had begged passage to
Hispaniola from Don Rodrigo, discovered, after
a time, a radical change in the disposition manifested
by the heterogeneous crew toward his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
white frock and all that it represented. In so
far as the discipline of Captain Hernandez permitted
open grumbling, the sailors grew outspoken
in their protests. The good priest, who
had found the crew devoted to their beads at the
outset of the voyage, was unable, as the weeks
went by, to persuade the sailors to put their
grievance into words. Nor was he able to keep
them at their prayers or to lead their voices in
quaint old Latin hymns. There was in the ship
a mysterious, elusive influence which had convinced
the impressionable, superstitious seamen
that the vessel was accursed and that somebody
aboard ship, being in league with Satan, was able
to nullify the effects of their religious observances.
Thus it was that the sweet-faced Carmelite
labored in vain to restore before the mast the
devout atmosphere which had prevailed among
the crew while the coast of Spain still lay but a
few miles astern.</p>

<p>Matters grew worse aboard the <i>Concepcion</i>
after the white friar had been put ashore at the
Indies and the clumsy vessel had begun to beat
up the Gulf of Mexico against baffling head-winds.
The sailors whispered to each other that
the desertion of the Carmelite had left the Prince
of Darkness in full control of the ship. To a
crew composed in large part of Spanish desperadoes,
with a sprinkling of Portuguese cutthroats,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
it was not easy to restore an atmosphere of religious
fervor after it had once been destroyed by
evil tongues. Experienced as he was in the
fickleness of the half-savage sailors who in those
adventurous days manned the omnipresent ships
of Spain, Captain Hernandez witnessed with
grave concern the gradual abandonment by his
crew of its religious attitude and the increasing
tendency of the sailors to imply, either by word
or manner, that Mary and the saints had abandoned
the ship to a cruel fate.</p>

<p>To Julia de Aquilar the voyage had become a
seemingly interminable imprisonment. The elation
which she had felt at the outset of the cruise
had never returned to her after the depressing
episode which had aroused in Juan Rodriquez a
deadly hatred for the captain of the ship. The
girl had caught the gleam of murder in the secretary&#8217;s
eyes as he lay out-stretched upon the
deck gazing upward at Gomez Hernandez, and
in her cabin, as she tossed restlessly in her hammock,
her mind grew sick with a foreboding
which waxed more insistent as the weary days
and nights crept by. Now and then she would
climb the clumsy ladder to walk the deck for
a while, but the dread of finding herself again
alone with Juan Rodriquez made her shy of this
diversion. Don Rodrigo, whose spirits rose
higher the nearer the ship approached the land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
in which his silver lay concealed, would enter
her stuffy cabin&mdash;a hole between decks hardly
worthy of the name&mdash;to rally her upon her indifference
to the splendors of the sea and the
polychromatic beauties of the islands on their
bow. Upon her father&#8217;s departure, the tears,
held back while he was by her side, would dim the
lustre of her splendid eyes, and her white, slender
hands would rise in supplication to the smiling
Virgin who looked down upon her from the
slanting wooden wall above her head.</p>

<p>Why had she, to whom the Old World offered
all its sweetest gifts, become a voluntary exile,
a hopeless maiden weeping in a corner of a vagrant
ship? Ever with her through those weary
weeks this question craved an answer. Ever
from the past arose the gorgeous pictures of her
former life, a life of courtly splendor where the
world was gay. In the dark watches of the
night, Do&ntilde;a Julia de Aquilar, half dozing, half
awake, would tread again the stately mazes of a
contre-dance or smile demurely upon a powdered
and bejewelled cavalier. She would hear again
the merry, mocking voices of Versailles or the
stately tones of Spanish gentlemen. Suddenly
the lurching of the ship would rouse her from
her waking dream, and, putting up a hand, as if
defying fate, she would touch the wooden walls
of her voluntary cell, walls that seemed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
bearing down upon her with the weight of
worlds, crushing out the color from her cheeks,
the light from her eyes, the joy of youth from
her rebellious soul.</p>

<p>But, waking or sleeping, one face was always
gazing at her from the past, a face which seemed
to laugh in courteous derision at her plight. &#8220;I
slew Don Josef&mdash;your betrothed,&#8221; the haunting
vision seemed to say, while upon the clear-cut
countenance which memory photographed the
girl could see the gay and mocking smile of one
who knew the world too well. Her betrothed?
Though dead, she hated him. Caprice and vanity
had forged for her the chains that had
made her, at Versailles, a captive, longing to be
free. And when her freedom came, when the
sword of him whose vibrant voice she could hear
above the creaking and groaning of the ship had
severed forever the bonds which tied her to an
unloved man, her liberty was nothing worth,
taking its revenge upon her for her former negligence
by coming back too late. She had learned,
through the gossip of a chattering court, that he
who had cut down her betrothed had fled across
the sea. Never again would she look upon de
Sancerre&#8217;s face, nor hear a voice which, while it
mocked at love, had thrilled her heart of hearts.
The years in passing would leave to her a memory&mdash;and
nothing more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>What mattered it, then, whether she passed
her weary span of life in the city of Seville or in
the strange environment toward which the ship
plunged on? In either case, the romance of her
youth was dead. That the strange chances of existence
would ever bring Louis de Sancerre again
to her side, Julia de Aquilar never dreamed. Even
in the prayers that she offered day and night to
the Virgin Mother above her head she had never
voiced a longing which, put into words, would
have sounded to her ears like the incipient ravings
of insanity. Her betrothed and the man whom
she had begun to love had both passed from her
life at the same moment, and through the gloom
of night there came to Do&ntilde;a Julia no ray of hope
save from the gentle radiance of Mother Church.
The veil, and its promise of perfect peace, grew
constantly more alluring to her distraught soul,
as week crept into week and the very timbers of
the ship cried ever louder against the cruel persistence
of the lonely sea.</p>

<p>From a dreamless sleep&mdash;a rare blessing vouchsafed
by Mother Mary&mdash;Do&ntilde;a Julia awoke one
night with a start and sat upright in her hammock,
peering into the darkness with straining
eyes. What had disturbed her slumber she did
not at first know. But above her head echoed
the shuffling sounds of hurrying feet, and the
flapping of canvas as the ship came about in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
stiff breeze. Leaping down from her hammock
and throwing a long, black cape over her shoulders,
she groped her way to the entrance to
her cabin and threw open the clumsy door. A
swinging lantern lighted the hatchway, and, almost
before her eyes had grown accustomed to
the sudden glare, above her head sounded the
grewsome cry of &#8220;Man overboard!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that instant down the ladder in front of the
trembling girl crept the slinking figure of Juan
Rodriquez. For a fleeting moment Do&ntilde;a Julia
caught a glimpse of the youth&#8217;s pallid face, upon
which there rested an evil smile made up of fear,
cruelty, and triumph. Believing himself unobserved,
Juan stood for a moment at the foot of
the ladder looking upward toward the deck and
listening intently to the uproar above his head.
Then, with a subdued chuckle, which sent a chill
through the heart of the motionless girl, he stole
into the shadows toward his berth amidships.</p>

<p>The harsh cries of the panic-stricken sailors
filled the night with a horrid din. The Spanish
maiden, undecided whether to climb to the deck
or to return to her hammock, crossed herself devoutly
and murmured a prayer to St. Christopher,
who watches over seamen and protects the faithful
from night alarms. The mischievous lantern,
vibrating wildly as the ship took the seas broadside
on, threw lights and shadows across the disturbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
face of the girl, and seemed to rejoice at
its chance to add to the uncanny features of her
surroundings.</p>

<p>The turmoil on the deck decreased as the moments
passed, but Do&ntilde;a Julia still stood waiting,
listening, praying; chafing at inaction, but distrustful
of the night beyond the hatchway. To
her, thus agitated, came her father down the ladder,
his worn figure bent as if it carried a great
burden. He turned and faced her, and as the
playful lantern swung toward them she saw that
his face was ghastly pale, and that his thin hand
trembled as he wiped the sea-spray from his furrowed
brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, father?&#8221; asked the girl, springing
toward Don Rodrigo and placing both hands
upon his shoulders as she peered into his white
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Hernandez,&#8221; muttered the old man,
in a voice that told the story of his despair&mdash;&#8220;he
fell into the sea. None saw him in the blackness
of the night, but far astern the helmsman
heard a cry&mdash;and that was all! God rest his
soul!&#8221; he groaned, crossing himself. &#8220;It will go
hard with us, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father&mdash;Mother Mary, pray for him!&mdash;the
voyage nears its end. Captain Hernandez&mdash;the
saints receive him!&mdash;had with him men who
know these seas?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;I trust them not,&#8221; murmured the old man,
wearily. Then, as if he regretted the admission
he had made, he bent and kissed the anxious
face of his daughter and said, with an effort at
cheerfulness, &#8220;But fear not, Julia. All will yet
be well. I&#8217;ve vowed an altar to St. James of
Compostella, whose blessing rests on pilgrims of
the faith. But how to calm the crew I hardly
know. The sailors seem nigh mad with fear.
They say that Satan is aboard the ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, I think he is,&#8221; murmured Julia to herself,
as she returned to her cabin and threw herself
despondently upon her swinging bed. That
she had solved by chance the awful secret of the
captain&#8217;s death, she could not for a moment
doubt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>IN WHICH SATAN HAS HIS WAY WITH THE<br />
<i>CONCEPCION</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawn</span> crept sullenly across the heaving bosom
of the gulf, as if disaffected by the night&#8217;s dark
deed. The sun gazed for a moment upon a ship
accursed, then hid its light behind black, evil-looking
clouds. From the east and south came
winds that smote the sea and dug deep valleys
in the briny waste. Then, where the valleys
gaped, great hills of water rose and wet the air,
and chased each other toward the wind-made
chasms just beyond. Losing their temper in their
wild career, the boisterous blasts let forth an
angry roar and lashed the waters viciously. Before
the dawn could take the name of day, a
mighty battle raged between the gale and gulf.</p>

<p>The command of the <i>Concepcion</i> had fallen to
Miquel Sanchez, a veteran seaman, but unskilled
in the nicer points of navigation. Knowing the
treacherous nature of the waters through which
his ship was reeling, uncertain of his course, and
depending for aid upon a sullen, superstitious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
crew, already persuaded that the vessel had been
doomed to destruction, the outlook seemed menacing,
wellnigh hopeless, to the new master of the
<i>Concepcion</i>, as he paced his narrow deck at dawn,
and hoarsely shouted orders for the taking in of
sail. The ship, showing her keel to the yawning
chasms in the sea, rushed affrighted under bare
poles through the welter toward the west. As
the storm increased in fury, the panic of the crew
grew less controllable. Even the helmsman strove
to tell his beads when the eyes of Sanchez turned
to scan the sky; and, broken by the howling
blasts, the noise of prayers and curses echoed
from the decks. The desperate sailors knew the
sea too well to hug the hope that such a ship as
theirs could foil the fury of the storm. Had not
a priest deserted them? Had not their captain
perished in the waves? Who doubted Satan&#8217;s
presence on the ship would be too dull to die!</p>

<p>Don Rodrigo de Aquilar had made his way
with much effort to Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s cabin, and had
found her on her knees before the painting of
the Virgin, praying for a miracle that should
snatch the vessel from its certain doom. The
girl&#8217;s face, above which raven-black locks were
coiled in picturesque disorder, was white from
the imminence of their peril, while her soft, dark
eyes gleamed with the fervor of her supplication.
As she arose to greet her father, the hand which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
she slipped into his was cold, but trembled not.
If the fear of death lurked in her heart, it was
only by the pallor of her cheek its presence could
be known. Her eyes were steady and her lips
were firm as she stood there reading her father&#8217;s
haggard face to find, if so the saints decreed, a
gleam of hope to cheer her soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s mercy on us all!&#8221; muttered the old
Spaniard, pressing his daughter&#8217;s hand to his
breast. &#8220;This Sanchez is as stubborn as a Moor!
He will not change his helm! I am no seaman,
but I&#8217;ve sat with poor Hernandez many an hour
and conned the chart of this same sea we sail.
But yesternoon he made a reckoning. If the sun
spake sooth, upon the course we hold we&#8217;ll dash
to pieces &#8217;gainst a curving coast. I told this sullen
Sanchez what I knew, but, &#8217;though he crossed
himself, he gave no heed to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s arm, showing white as marble
against the black cloak hanging from his shoulders,
was thrown around her father&#8217;s neck. Kissing
his pallid cheek, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no love of life; no fear of death! To
die with you, my father&mdash;will it be so hard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To die without confession&mdash;that is hard!&#8221; exclaimed
Don Rodrigo, despondently. &#8220;I begged
the Carmelite to stay with us; but, still, he gave
me absolution ere he left. And if I perish, &#8217;tis
for Mother Church! But listen, Julia! I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
old and worn. A few years more or less are little
worth. But you are young. You must not die,
my child! If I had lured you to an ocean grave,
I&#8217;m sure my soul would find no peace in Paradise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia had seated herself upon the edge
of her uneasy hammock, and was looking down
at her father, who had attempted to maintain an
upright posture upon the treacherous surface of
a sea-chest fastened by clamps to the cabin floor.
Suddenly the old Spaniard arose and stumbled
to the hatchway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Juan!&#8221; he cried, striving to cast his voice
amidships in spite of the howling of the gale, the
ominous thumping of the loosened ballast, the
cries of frantic sailors, and the thunder of the
seas as they pounded vengefully against the frail
timbers of the ship. &#8220;Juan Rodriquez, come
aft at once! Juan! Juan!&#8221;</p>

<p>A hand, cold as ice, was clapped upon the old
man&#8217;s white and trembling lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, I implore you, do not summon him,&#8221;
prayed Julia, striving to drag the aged Spaniard
back into her cabin. &#8220;He cannot serve you
now. For Mother Mary&#8217;s sake, I beg of you to
leave him to his prayers. He has sore need of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her protest came too late. In the dim, gray
light of the hatchway the girl caught sight of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
face which even in that awful hour wore an inscrutable,
evil smile, as if the diabolical spirit of
the storm had rejoiced the soul of Juan Rodriquez.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re driving fast, Juan, upon an unknown
coast,&#8221; said Don Rodrigo, coolly, a detaining arm
thrown around his daughter&#8217;s waist. &#8220;You&#8217;re
lithe and muscular, and come of fearless stock.
I&#8217;ve seen you in the water at Seville.&#8221; At this
moment the increasing uproar aboard ship compelled
the old man to raise his thin voice to
a shout. Drawing from his breast a package
wrapped in oil-skin, he thrust it toward the out-stretched
hand of his secretary. &#8220;Here is my
patent from the King of Spain. &#8217;Twill serve as
Julia&#8217;s title to the mines&mdash;to the greater glory of
our Mother Church! And, for the sake of heathen
souls beyond, your arm, my Juan, must save
my daughter from these hungry seas. I say to
you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, as you love me, as you hope for Paradise,
put no trust in this man&#8217;s loyalty! If
you must die, I do not care to live. A thousand
deaths were better than a life saved
by a&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At that instant a crash, as if the storm had
served as usher to the crack of doom, drove the
word she would have uttered back upon her
tongue. Don Rodrigo&#8217;s white head was turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
to crimson by its impact with an iron-jointed
beam, and, plunging forward, he lay dead beside
his daughter&#8217;s feet. Do&ntilde;a Julia tottered forward
a step or two, and then fell swooning into Juan&#8217;s
arms.</p>

<small>IN WHICH TWO CHILDREN OF THE SUN ASTONISH A<br />
SCOUNDREL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the day was ended the winds and
waves had signed a truce, but on the beach, far
to the westward of the Mississippi&#8217;s mouth, lay
ghastly trophies of their recent war. In a vain
effort to propitiate the demon of the storm&mdash;according
to the Portuguese sailors: to lighten
the vessel, the captain would have said&mdash;cables,
spars, water-casks, kits and chests of varying size,
puncheons of wine, bags of sea-biscuit, cannon,
powder, and stone ballast had been thrown overboard
in a futile effort to float the shattered ship
from a sunken reef. A portion of this impotent
sacrifice the sullen surf had uplifted upon
its crest, and, rushing shoreward, had tossed it
spitefully upon the sands.</p>

<p>As the hours dragged on, while the storm, in
full retreat, hurried its black battalions toward
the west, the moaning beach became a resting-place
for grimmer flotsam than sailor&#8217;s kit or
broken spar. Trusting to the stanchness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
their ships and the favor of their saints, the
Spanish seamen in those adventurous days but
seldom learned to swim. In constant peril from
the hungry waves, forever searching unknown
seas, where shipwreck menaced him at every hour,
the Spaniard or the Portuguese would drown,
amazed to find no saving potency in strings of
beads, no buoyancy in dangling crucifix.</p>

<p>When the ship <i>Concepcion</i>, abandoned by the
saints, struck on a rock, concealed beneath the
waves by Satan&#8217;s crafty hand, there was only one
man aboard the vessel who had learned to breast
the surf with strength and skill sufficient for a
crisis such as this&mdash;and he was a white-faced
landsman, who had spent his life with pen and
books, learning nothing of the sea save what had
come to him when bathing in the sunny waters
of Seville.</p>

<p>For the first time in all the countless centuries
since the floods had tossed it there, the curving
beach now watched the grewsome pastime which
a shipwreck grants the surf. A shadow on a
billow rushing landward, a black spot on a white-plumed,
tossing wave, a splash and hissing on
the trembling sands, and there on the shore, as
the storm-wind rushes by, lies a thing which was
once a man, a black-and-white blotch in the dim
light vouchsafed by the scudding clouds. With
uncanny satisfaction at its task, the undercurrent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
slinking back again beneath the sea, returns
to lay upon the sands another horrid plaything
of the surf. &#8217;Tis novel sport for this deserted
coast, but how the waves enjoy it! They roar
and thunder, sob and laugh and hiss; they toss
their new-found toys upon the sands, then snatch
them back again and turn them &#8217;round and
&#8217;round as if in envy of the grasping beach. But
as the hours pass by, the shore keeps gaining
what the billows lose. When the sun has pierced
the western clouds, to cast a passing gleam across
the panting sea, the glistening sands are dotted
far and wide with worthless relics of the surf&#8217;s
grim sport.</p>

<p>The arms of Juan Rodriquez had been moved
by mighty passions to a most stupendous feat.
Strong swimmer though he was, the burden of a
senseless girl, and the striving of the deep to
make no blunder in the game it played, had
turned his heart to ice, while the minutes seemed
like hours and each stroke that he made was feebler
than the last. But the struggling wretch was
urged to mad endeavor by a combination of the
most potent motives which can inspire the efforts
of a man. Fear of death and love of a woman
united in that awful hour to give to Juan&#8217;s slender
but well-knit body a stubborn endurance that
foiled the undertow and checked, for the nonce,
the surf&#8217;s ghastly pastime. Slowly but persistently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
with gasping breath and straining eyes,
now smothered in the brine, now lifted like a
cork upon a wave, a man who was not fit to die
fought wildly with the sea for life and love. To
leave the girl to drown and struggle on alone,
with certain victory within his grasp, his dread
of death had tempted him to do. But at that instant
a kindlier current than he had hoped to
find eased for a moment the pressure upon his
chest, and bore him slantingly athwart the beach
far westward of the wrecked <i>Concepcion</i>.</p>

<p>To the fainting youth and his senseless burden
the damp strand offered no easy couch, but it
was better to lie there on the shore, while the
enemy, checkmated, scolded and threatened and
boasted in complaining impotence just outside
the danger-line, than to choke and die, and go to
judgment unshrived and with black crimes upon
one&#8217;s soul. What mattered it to Juan Rodriquez
that for a time, as he lay struggling for breath
upon the beach, the ripples, malicious offspring
of the giant breakers, washed moist sand into his
hair and ears, and licked his corpselike face as
if they kissed him for his prowess while they
whispered vengeful threats?</p>

<p>Presently the victorious swimmer regained his
senses, and, tottering to his feet, dragged the
shrunken figure of Do&ntilde;a Julia further up the
beach. Her black gown clung close around her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
as she lay, as if asleep, upon the sands, the only
thing of beauty that the sea had brought to land.
Juan bent down and placed his hand upon her
bosom. The gleam of despair in his sunken eyes
died out as he felt the feeble beating of her heart
and upon his cheek the faint impact of her returning
breath. Then he drew himself up to his
full height, cast a glance of triumph at the
treacherous sea, and, assured of Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s
safety, hurried eastward across the shingle, glistening
at that moment from the rays of the setting
sun.</p>

<p>It was a dismal task that the dripping, trembling
youth had essayed. From one staring,
motionless victim of the storm to another went
Juan, placing his shaking hand above hearts
which would never beat again, and starting
back in horror from faces which served as mirrors
to the pain of sudden death. And ever as
he crept on from one purple corpse to another
the conviction became more fixed in his mind
that he alone, of all the sturdy men upon that
fated ship, had kept the spark of life within his
breast. Suddenly the sightless eyes of Miquel
Sanchez stared up at him in the sunlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curse you! Curse you!&#8221; cried Juan, kicking
the unprotesting corpse in senseless rage. &#8220;Had
I known you were a lubber, Hernandez had not
died! &#8217;Tis well for you the sea took all your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
life, or I&#8217;d choke the dying breath from out your
throat! Curse you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bending down, the youth, a madman for the
instant, seized a handful of moist sand and hurled
it spitefully into the upturned face of the man
whose stubborn ignorance had placed in jeopardy
his schemes for self-aggrandizement. But at
that horrid moment Juan Rodriquez knew, for
self-confession forced itself upon him, that it was
his own weak yielding to the thirst for vengeance
which had wrecked the vessel. Coward
that he was, the fury of his self-reproach found
vicious vent upon a lifeless trunk that had no
power of protest against so grave a wrong.</p>

<p>The fervor of his unjust anger spent, Juan
turned, like a snarling cur, from the outraged
corpse, and, hungry for human intercourse, resolved
to return at once to Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s side,
restore her to her senses, and fortify his faltering
heart by the sound of a living voice.
He had gazed into dead men&#8217;s faces until his
soul was sick with the horror of the day. He
glanced at the sinking sun petulantly, as if he
awaited with impatience the black shroud that
oncoming night would throw over the motionless
bodies scattered along the beach.</p>

<p>Suddenly the youth, an expression of mingled
astonishment, horror, and fear upon his changing
face, fell upon his knees and crossed himself with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
a fervor begotten of the miracle upon which his
straining eyes now gazed.</p>

<p>Beside the out-stretched figure of Do&ntilde;a Julia
stood two angelic beings, taller than the run of
men, who faced the sun and raised their arms
straight upward toward the evening sky. They
wore white robes, and from the distant dune to
which the startled Juan crawled it seemed as if
golden halos glorified the heads of these marvellous
messengers from Paradise. They stood for
a time with arms upraised, while to the straining
ears of a youth whose heart felt like a lump
of ice came the subdued notes of a chant which,
he knew full well, was music not of earthly
origin. Presently the angels bent their heads
together, as if in heavenly converse, while Juan
cast a stealthy glance across the sun-red sands
to see if Miquel Sanchez had roused himself
from death to totter toward God&#8217;s envoys with
an awful accusation upon his lips. When his
eyes turned toward the west again, relieved to
find the sailor still lying stark and still, Juan
saw that the angels had gently uplifted the body
of Julia de Aquilar, and, with stately grace, were
bearing it away toward the twilight of the foot-hills.
With his wet garments chilling the very
marrow in his bones, the thief and murderer
watched these celestial beings bearing his love
away to Paradise. The grim mockery of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
chattering prayer that he breathed he could not
comprehend. He paid the homage of furtive
worship to angels whose searching glance, he
feared, might seek him out behind his sandy
lurking-place.</p>

<p>The red-fringed twilight had lost its glow,
and the zenith had pinned a star upon its breast
before Juan Rodriquez, still trembling at the
miracle that he had seen, found courage to slink
westward along the shore. Behind him dead
men seemed to stalk, following his footsteps with
grim persistence, while somewhere from the
hills upon his right the eyes of angels searched
his very soul. On across the beach he hurried,
while the waters of the gulf turned black, and
the dread silence of the night was broken only
by the gossip of the waves, telling the sands a
horrid secret that they had learned.</p>

<p>Alone with his thoughts, with the memory of
dark crimes upon his soul, Juan strove through
the long night to cast far behind him the haunted
shore upon which angels came and went. The
interplay of life and death had left him only this&mdash;the
hope of wealth. Had he known that between
him and the silver mines that he sought
lay more than a thousand weary miles, he would
have made a pillow of the sand in his despair.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>IN WHICH THE CROSS IS CARRIED TO A CITY OF<br />
IDOLATERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I have</span> learned something of these proud
pagans, Chat&eacute;muc. They are worshippers of
fire; fruit ripe to pluck, to the greater glory of
Mother Church.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Mohican grunted in acquiescence as he
strode forward, a copper-colored giant by the
side of the gray-garbed, undersized Franciscan.</p>

<p>Beneath budding trees and along a flower-haunted
trail went de la Salle&#8217;s envoys to the
children of the sun. It was high noon, and the
god of the idolaters shone down upon those who
would dethrone him as a deity with a kindly
radiance behind which no malice lurked. Mayhap
the warm-hearted luminary had grown
weary of the human sacrifices offered up by his
deluded worshippers, and was pleased to see the
gentle Membr&eacute; carrying a cross, symbol of a
faith which demands for its altars no gifts but
contrite hearts, toward a blood-stained city in
which a savage cult still lay as a curse upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
a race endowed by nature with many kindly
traits.</p>

<p>Between Membr&eacute;, the friar, and Chat&eacute;muc, the
Mohican, had long existed a cordial friendship,
based, in part, upon hardships and dangers shared
together, but more especially upon the relationship
existing between them of a missionary to a
convert. Of the many native Americans who
had become good children of Mother Church under
the inspiring influence of the magnetic Franciscan
none had been more faithful to his adopted
religion than the stately Mohican, whose proud,
reserved, but inherently enthusiastic temperament
derived warmth and inspiration from the friar&#8217;s
exalted soul. Of late years much of Zenobe
Membr&eacute;&#8217;s success as a proselyter had been due
to long and earnest consultations held in the wilderness
with Chat&eacute;muc, an Indian understanding
Indians, and a Roman Catholic who spoke
French.</p>

<p>Just in front of the Mohican and the Franciscan
walked Katonah by the side of de Sancerre;
a forest belle attended by a courtly swain. Used
as he was to the startling contrasts which the
exodus of Europeans to the New World had begotten
in such abundance, the friar had been
struck by the incongruity of this pair, who
laughed and chatted just beyond him with a
gayety born of the sunshine and the spring.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>At the head of the little procession strode the
soldierly Henri de Tonti, attended on either hand
by a long-limbed child of the sun. The Italian
veteran looked like a pygmy beside his tall,
white-garbed, black-haired guides, who stalked
along on his flanks with a stately grace which
had aroused the enthusiastic admiration of de
Sancerre, a cosmopolite who had in his time
looked upon many well-formed warriors both in
the Old World and the New.</p>

<p>&#8220;They worship fire, Chat&eacute;muc,&#8221; repeated the
Franciscan, earnestly, after a moment&#8217;s silence.
&#8220;Their god is the sun, and they have a priesthood
whose duty it is to keep alive in their temple a
blaze of logs, first lighted, generations back, by
the sun itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Mohican turned and looked down at the
friar with a gleam of mingled astonishment and
inquiry in his melancholy eyes. The grunt to
which he gave vent the Franciscan well understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are amazed at my knowledge of their
customs, my Chat&eacute;muc,&#8221; remarked the Franciscan,
smilingly. &#8220;But have I not heard many
wild and horrid tales in the years through
which I&#8217;ve borne the cross to outlands such
as this? &#8217;Tis strange, indeed, how rumor flies
through forests, over lakes, and makes the
mountains rear their tops in vain. &#8217;Tis thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
the saints work miracles for us, that we may
bear the Word to savage lands. As feeble men,
we could do naught, my son; but with the
pioneers of Mother Church march all the hosts
of heaven, and when the day is darkest and the
heathen shout for joy, there comes a wonder,
some marvel on the earth, some sudden splendor
of the midnight sky, and the cross, triumphant,
gains another tribe! Oh, Chat&eacute;muc, the glory
of it all!&#8221;</p>

<p>The gray eyes of the Franciscan gazed upward
at the set face of the seemingly stoical Indian,
whose religious enthusiasm was rapidly rising to
fever-heat under the intoxicating influence of the
fanatical friar&#8217;s carefully-chosen words&mdash;words
whose effect upon the devout Mohican Zenobe
Membr&eacute; was not now testing for the first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;But their fire, father? It always burns?&#8221;
asked Chat&eacute;muc, presently, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Day and night, year after year, from generation
to generation, they keep alive this idolatrous
blaze, a flame lighted in hell and carried to
these pagans by Satan&#8217;s self. And while it
burns, my Chat&eacute;muc, &#8217;twill be impossible to lure
their souls to Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>The searching gaze of the friar scanned closely
the phlegmatic face of the Mohican. Not a
muscle in Chat&eacute;muc&#8217;s copper-colored countenance
moved, but a dangerous gleam had begun to flash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
in his eyes as they rested now and again upon
the white-robed sun-worshippers striding on
ahead of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They guard the fire by day and night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis never left alone, my son,&#8221; answered the
Franciscan, fully satisfied with the effect that
his words had had upon Chat&eacute;muc.</p>

<p>The native American is not a rash and impulsive
being. Courageous Chat&eacute;muc was, beyond
many of his race; but he was, nevertheless, an
Indian, and inclined to attain his ends by craft
and subtlety rather than by reckless daring. It
was not until the French had introduced the
native American to the civilizing influence of
brandy that the latter abandoned, at times, in
his warfare the methods of a snake, and fought,
now and then, like a lion.</p>

<p>&#8220;How large a guard, my father, do they keep
around their fire?&#8221; asked the Mohican, presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I do not know, my son. But bear this in
mind, good Chat&eacute;muc: against a soldier fighting
for the cross the powers of hell cannot prevail.
Remember, Chat&eacute;muc, that unless that blaze is
turned to ashes in their sight, my prayers and
exhortations will be of no avail. We&#8217;ll leave
them pagans as we found them, unless their
sacred fire no longer burns.&#8221;</p>

<p>The vibrant notes in the friar&#8217;s rich voice rekindled
the light in the Indian&#8217;s gloomy eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;Either the fire or a Mohican shall die, my
father!&#8221; exclaimed the warrior, in low, earnest
tones. &#8220;Chat&eacute;muc, your son in Christ, has
sworn an oath.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the high spirits of Louis de Sancerre
had cast their spell upon Katonah, a maiden
whose ready smile seldom changed to laughter.
But on this bright spring day, treading a flower-bedecked
path by the side of a man whose delicately
chiselled face was to her eyes a symbol
of all the joy of life, it was not hard for the
Mohican maiden to affect a gayety uncharacteristic
of a race lacking in vivacity.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are splendid fellows,&#8221; remarked de
Sancerre, gazing at the stalwart messengers from
the Brother of the Sun. &#8220;With ten thousand
men like these, Turenne could have marched
around the world. But our mission to them is
one of peace. I must teach them the steps of
the <i>menuet</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is that?&#8221; asked Katonah, glancing
over her shoulder to see whether Chat&eacute;muc&#8217;s rebuking
eye was fixed upon her. To her great satisfaction
she discovered that her brother seemed
to be absorbed in the words of the gray friar.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>menuet, ma petite</i>? &#8217;Twas made for
you. &#8217;Tis a <i>coup&eacute;e</i>, a high step and a balance.
Your untrammelled grace, Katonah, would hurt
the eyes of <i>mesdames</i> at Versailles.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Little of this the Indian maiden understood,
but she realized intuitively that her cavalier had
been paying her an honest compliment. Her
quick ear, more sensitive to the changes in his
voice than to all other sounds, had learned to
detect and dread a sarcastic note in his tones
that often cut her to the heart. But on this
gay noontide of a day at the close of what the
sun-worshippers called the Moon of Strawberries,
Louis de Sancerre was a joyous, frank, vivacious
man who paid the beautiful savage at his side
acceptable homage with his eyes and in whose
words she could find nothing to wound her
pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we reach this sun-baked centre of
idolatry, <i>ma petite</i>,&#8221; remarked De Sancerre, presently,
&#8220;we must make an effort to remain side
by side. Though I should pass a thousand years
in harems of the Turks, I could not forget the
face of that old hag who came to haunt me by
my lonely couch. &#8217;Tis her you are to find&mdash;for
the greater glory of our Mother Church. But
bear this in mind, <i>petite</i>, that I must have some
speech with her before the friar seizes on her
tongue and makes her Spanish eloquent for
Christ. I&#8217;d ask her of a miracle, before good
Membr&eacute; goes to work with his.&#8221;</p>

<p>For Katonah the glory of the day had passed.
The gleam of happiness died slowly in her eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
and the smile which lingered still upon her lips
had lost its joyousness. Not only had the mocking
echo returned to de Sancerre&#8217;s voice, but he
had recalled to the girl&#8217;s mind the story that
he had told her, earlier in the day, of a Spanish
maiden whose name had come to him so strangely
in the dark hours of the night. It was, then,
the memory of a maiden over-sea which had led
the Frenchman&#8217;s footsteps toward the city of the
sun! The misery in Katonah&#8217;s heart crept into
her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll serve you as I can,&#8221; she said, gently, her
eyes avoiding his. &#8220;But,&#8221; and she lowered her
tones until her words became a warning made in
whispers&mdash;&#8220;but I say to you, monsieur, beware
of Chat&eacute;muc! Stay not by my side. I&#8217;ll serve
you as I can, but leave me when we reach the
town. Believe me when I say &#8217;tis safer so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi, ma petite</i>,&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre,
petulantly, turning his head to cast a glance behind
him at Chat&eacute;muc, &#8220;your warning, though
well meant, was hardly fair to him! Your
brother is too good a friend of Mother Church
to harbor hatred of a Catholic like me, who only
yesternight vowed three long candles to the Virgin-mother&mdash;after
that ugly crone had left my
side at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You smile, and speak light words,&#8221; murmured
Katonah, deprecatingly. &#8220;But I say to you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
beware of Chat&eacute;muc. He loves the faith, but
hateth you, monsieur. I know not why. &#8217;Tis
strange!&#8221;</p>

<p>She gazed at the Frenchman&#8217;s face with a
frank admiration which brought a self-conscious
smile to the courtier&#8217;s lips. Flicking a multicolored
insect from the tattered velvet of his sleeve,
de Sancerre exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my Katonah! &#8217;Tis those who know me
best who love me best. Your brother is a stranger,
who cannot read my heart. But, hark! what
have we here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The noise of kettle-drums and the howling of a
great throng arose in front of them. Their stately
guides withdrew from de Tonti&#8217;s side and stalked
sedately to the rear of the little group of strangers,
leaving the Italian captain to lead his followers
to the imminent outskirts of the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to the drums, <i>petite</i>!&#8221; exclaimed de
Sancerre, gayly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll dance a <i>menuet</i> in
yonder city, or I am not a moonbeam&#8217;s favorite
son!&#8221;</p>

<small>IN WHICH THE BROTHER OF THE SUN WELCOMES<br />
THE CHILDREN OF THE MOON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Brother of the Sun, overjoyed at the opportunity
now before him to offer hospitality to
guests upon whose white faces he gazed with
mingled admiration and astonishment, had come
in state to the confines of the forest to testify
to the cordiality of a greeting that illuminated
his well-cut, strong, and mobile countenance.
The Great Sun, as he was called&mdash;his exact relationship
to the orb of day being, to a large
extent, a matter of conjecture&mdash;was an elderly
man, fully six feet six inches in height, with a
light-mahogany complexion, hair still jet-black,
and brilliant, dark eyes gazing proudly forth
upon a world which, from the hour of his birth,
had paid abject homage to his exalted rank.</p>

<p>He was enthroned in a litter resembling a huge
sedan-chair, which was carried upon the shoulders
of eight stalwart men in white attire but bare-footed.
The four long arms of the litter were
painted red, and its body was decorated with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
embroidered deer-skins, leaves of the magnolia-tree,
and garlands of red and white flowers. His
head was ornamented by a diadem of white feathers.
Inserted in the lobes of his shapely ears
were rings of decorated bone. He wore a necklace
made of the teeth of alligators, and against
the background of his raven-black hair gayly
colored beads shone in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Behind his litter marched a mighty army of
three thousand stalwart men, bare-armed, bare-legged,
in a uniform of flowing, white, plaited
mulberry bark, relieved by dyed skins, striped
with yellow, black, and red, thrown across their
broad shoulders. They carried bows made of
the acacia-wood, and arrows of reed tipped with
bird-feathers. Gigantic, muscular, stern-faced
warriors, the army of the sun-worshippers broke
upon the gaze of the astonished Europeans with
startling effect.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that the immediate ancestors
of these children of the sun, angered at Montezuma,
had joined Cortez in his victorious campaign
against that unfortunate monarch. Later
on, crushed and rebellious under Spanish tyranny,
they had migrated toward the north and had
found peaceful lands to their liking near the
banks of the lower Mississippi. Whatever may be
the truth of this, the fact remains that upon the
afternoon which found Sieur de la Salle&#8217;s envoys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
the honored guests of the Brother of the Sun,
the latter&#8217;s army defiled to the eastward of the
city with ranks which begot in the eyes of the
Count de Sancerre and the veteran de Tonti a
gleam of mingled amazement and admiration.
Not only were the warriors of the sun, individually,
men suggesting prowess and endurance,
but they, as a body, gave evidence of having
learned, from sources beyond the reach of native
Americans further to the northward, tactics indicating
a European origin. If the sun-worshippers
had, in fact, suffered from Spanish cruelty,
they had also derived from their tyrannical allies
valuable hints pertaining to the art of war. As
he gazed at this army of athletes, Henri de Tonti,
for the first time since he had left de la Salle&#8217;s
camp, felt regret for the protest he had made
against the expedition which his leader had decreed.
Here before him stood a splendid band
of soldiers who might be made, with some diplomacy,
loyal friends to the on-pushing French.</p>

<p>To the mind of Zenobe Membr&eacute; the martial
array before him presented a magnificent collection
of lost souls, well worthy, in outward seeming,
of the saving grace of the cross. To snatch
from the grasp of Satan so many glorious exponents
of manly vigor would be, indeed, a triumph
for Mother Church. Something of this he
breathed into the ear of the motionless and silent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Chat&eacute;muc, who stood with the friar upon a low
hillock, overlooking the plain, viewing with
amazement this imposing regiment, each member
of which seemed to be taller by several
inches than the stately Mohican.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Katonah!&#8221; cried de Sancerre, seizing
the Indian maiden by the arm. &#8220;See, there, at
the side of his dark-brown Majesty&#8217;s peripatetic
flower-garden, stands my aged midnight prowler!
Her old face is turned up to his. Can you see
her, <i>ma petite</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Katonah stretched her shapely limbs to their
utmost to look above the press in front of her, and
presently her eyes lighted upon the shrivelled
crone with whose discovery she had been intrusted
by de la Salle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to your brother and keep the friar by his
side until I return, Katonah,&#8221; whispered the
Frenchman, excitedly. &#8220;I must have speech at
once with this old hag.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sun-worshippers, pouring in throngs from
their abandoned city&mdash;men, women, and children
following and preceding the army in the
fervor of their welcome to the white-faced children
of the moon, who had come to them so
mysteriously from the bosom of a wonder-working
stream&mdash;impeded, by their respectful but exacting
curiosity, the progress of de Sancerre
toward the royal group. Women, scantily clad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
but gay with flowers and feathers, would put
forth their brown hands to touch the tattered
velvets of the Frenchman&#8217;s travel-stained but
once gorgeous costume. Naked boys and girls
squirmed toward him unabashed, marvelling at
the pallor of his face and the splendor of the
buckles upon his shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Peste!</i>&#8221; muttered the annoyed courtier under
his breath. &#8220;If they but knew how hard I have
to strive to hold these outworn garments to my
back, they&#8217;d keep their hands away. I&#8217;ll reach
the royal presence as naked as a baby unless they
grow more gentle with my garb.&#8221; And all the
time he smiled and bowed, while men and women,
boys and girls, cried out in wild approval of
his courtly grace.</p>

<p>Henri de Tonti, who had lost much of his
European polish through the long friction of
camps and the wilderness, had reached the Great
Sun&#8217;s flowery throne without winning the enthusiastic
good-will of these impressionable adult
children, who seemed to feel instinctively that
the unbending, sallow, grim-faced Italian was
less worthy, somehow, of their friendship than
the fascinating, smiling Frenchman who followed
gayly in the footsteps of the unmagnetic captain
toward their king. In the presence of royalty
the advantage in address possessed by de Sancerre
over de Tonti was emphasized at once.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
With curt ceremony the Italian had saluted the
smiling, black-eyed monarch, and had then stood
silent, gazing helplessly upon the expectant
throng pressing toward the litter, in the vain
hope of finding some way to communicate with
the royal sun-worshipper.</p>

<p>De Sancerre&#8217;s triumphal progress toward the
throne had attracted the attention of the Brother
of the Sun, and the plaudits of his subjects had
led the latter to believe that the leading personage
among his pale-faced guests was now before
him. Falling gracefully upon one knee, the
Frenchman kissed the out-stretched hand of the
beaming King with a flourish and a fervor which
aroused the admiring multitude to a fresh outburst
of delighted shouts.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, your Majesty!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre,
in French, as he arose to his feet, &#8220;the encore
warms my blood like wine! I like your
people! They see at once the difference &#8217;twixt
a curmudgeon and a cavalier.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes rested triumphantly upon the countenance
of the disconcerted de Tonti for a moment,
and then looked forth upon the sea of dusky,
smiling faces upturned to his. Almost within
reach of his hand stood the old woman who had
borne to his bedside a welcome from the children
of the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well met, se&ntilde;ora!&#8221; cried de Sancerre, in Spanish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
to the grinning hag. &#8220;Come to me here!
Your tongue shall bind the ties of love between
your king and mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>With the quickness of perception which his
bright eyes indicated, the Brother of the Sun
seemed to grasp the significance of de Sancerre&#8217;s
last words, for he beckoned to the aged crone to
approach the royal presence. With a rapidity
of motion strangely out of keeping with her
time-worn appearance, the old woman reached
de Sancerre&#8217;s side on the instant, and, having
made her obeisance to the throne, stood looking
up at the Frenchman expectantly. To the latter&#8217;s
astonishment he saw in her small, black,
beady eyes a gleam of saturnine humor which
assured him that between his soul and hers
stretched at least one sympathetic bond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say to his Majesty for my king, my people,
and myself,&#8221; went on de Sancerre, in Spanish,
holding the gaze of the interpreter to his, &#8220;that
our hearts beat with joy at the welcome you extend
to us. Say to him that the king of kings,
far beyond the great water of the sea, sends
greeting to his Brother of the Sun, and craves
his friendship for all time to come. This much
at once; but, later on, assure his Majesty I
hope to lay before him plans and projects worthy
of his warlike fame, that he, your monarch, and
my king of kings may know no equals &#8217;neath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
the sun and moon.&#8221; De Sancerre paused to give
the interpreter a chance to turn his words into
her native tongue. (&#8220;In sooth,&#8221; he muttered to
himself, as he turned to smile again upon the
now silent throng surrounding the low hillock
upon which the King&#8217;s litter stood, &#8220;had I but
shown myself so great a diplomat in France, I
might have changed the map of Europe with my
tongue and pen.&#8221;) &#8220;And what, se&ntilde;ora, saith the
Son of Suns?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He answers you with words of deepest love,&#8221;
answered the old woman, turning toward the
Frenchman from the royal sun-worshipper, whose
dark-hued face glowed with the delight de Sancerre&#8217;s
adroitly-framed sentences had begotten.
&#8220;He offers the hand of friendship to your king,
the Brother of the Moon, and will divide with
him the waters and the lands in perfect amity.
He bids me say to you that in this day the children
of the sun find glorious fulfilment of ancient
prophecies. Before the East had parted
from the West, and North and South were wrapped
in close embrace, &#8217;twas told by wise, inspired
tongues that some day by the waters of a boundless
sea a goddess in deep sleep, sent to our people
by the sun itself, would meet the eyes of
roving huntsmen, wandering far afield. Our
seers have told us that when she had come&mdash;Coyocop,
the very spirit of the sun, our god&mdash;our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
race would meet our brothers of the moon,
and all the world would bow beneath our yoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre, impatient by temperament, and
finding difficulty in fully understanding the disjointed
Spanish <i>patois</i> used by the old woman,
had paid but little real attention to this long
speech, in spite of the attitude of absorbed interest
which he had assumed, knowing that the
piercing eyes of the sun&#8217;s brother were scanning
his face attentively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name is, se&ntilde;ora&mdash;is&mdash;&#8221; he asked, as the
wrinkled hag paused an instant to regain her
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noco,&#8221; she answered, simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do&ntilde;a Noco, say to his Majesty that others of
our suite are approaching the throne to lay their
homage at his feet, and that I, his servant, crave
further speech with him anon. Then, se&ntilde;ora, if
you love me, draw aside a pace or two, that I
may have a word with you alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly had de Sancerre ceased to speak when
through an opening in the throng made by the
courteous sun-worshippers came toward the
throne the gray-frocked friar, Zenobe Membr&eacute;,
followed by Katonah and Chat&eacute;muc, side by
side. The Franciscan, chanting in a light but
well-rounded voice a Latin hymn, bore aloft before
him a rudely-carved wooden crucifix. With
his large gray eyes raised to heaven, and his face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
radiant with the religious ecstasy which filled
his soul, he looked, at that moment, to the eyes
of the overwrought sun-worshippers, like a man
created of shadows and moonbeams, bearing
toward their sovereign a mystic symbol potent
for good or ill.</p>

<p>The effect of the friar&#8217;s dramatic approach
upon the impressionable Brother of the Sun
served de Sancerre&#8217;s purpose well. Unobserved
by the King, whose eyes were fixed upon the
chanting priest, the Frenchman seized this opportunity
to draw Noco aside. Removing from
his breast the piece of mulberry bark upon which
was scrawled the name of Julia de Aquilar, he
asked, in a whisper which did not disguise his
excitement:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who wrote this name? Tell me, Do&ntilde;a Noco,
for the love of God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Coyocop,&#8221; muttered the hag, in a voice indicating
the fear that she felt of the Frenchman&#8217;s
impetuosity. Her answer conveyed no meaning
to the straining ear of de Sancerre.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me more, good Noco,&#8221; he implored,
glancing furtively at the Brother of the Sun, who
had arisen to greet the oncoming Franciscan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not&mdash;now,&#8221; whispered Noco, nervously.
&#8220;Anon, perhaps, if the chance should
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this unsatisfactory promise the interpreter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
returned to resume her duties at her sovereign&#8217;s
side, and de Sancerre, mystified and
morose, turned to watch the efforts of Zenobe
Membr&eacute; to dethrone the deified sun in favor of
the true God.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>IN WHICH CHAT&Eacute;MUC FINDS THE INSPIRATION WHICH<br />
HE LACKED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;<span class="smcap">Twas</span> as I said it would be, my Chat&eacute;muc,&#8221;
exclaimed Membr&eacute;, mournfully, as the friar and
his convert retired from the immediate presence
of royalty. &#8220;As long as yonder temple protects
its hellish fire, the ears of this great monarch
will be deaf to words of mine. Mother of God,
&#8217;tis sad! He has a noble face! I would that I
might live to shrive him of the many sins his
haughty pride begets!&#8221;</p>

<p>Chat&eacute;muc gave vent to what might have been
a pious groan, though it sounded to a listening
group of sun-worshippers like the grunt of an
ill-tempered man. The half-civilized Mohican
had good reasons for his discontented mood.
His unexpected discovery of a race of native
Americans taller, better proportioned, and seemingly
more muscular than his kinsmen of the
North, had touched his sullen pride. Furthermore,
Chat&eacute;muc felt that he had been made a
victim, at the very foot of the throne, of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
cleverly designed conspiracy. De Sancerre had
spoken a few words to Noco, and the latter had
addressed the King himself. In his native tongue
the Great Sun had issued an order which had
been translated by Noco into Spanish, and which
de Sancerre had turned into French for the benefit&mdash;or,
rather, for the disturbance&mdash;of Chat&eacute;muc.
The royal behest had been uncompromising
in its curt simplicity. The Brother of the
Sun had ordered Noco to act as hostess to Katonah
during the latter&#8217;s sojourn within his domain.
Annoyed as the Mohican had been at
this command, he had reluctantly recognized the
futility of an open protest against the disposition
made, without his consent, of his sister. He had
retired with the Franciscan from the group surrounding
the King&#8217;s litter, with a burning desire
in his heart to make mischief. Quick to read
the mind of Chat&eacute;muc, the gray friar, whose
open zeal as a proselyter had been changed, by
the Great Sun&#8217;s stubborn indifference to the
awful significance of the crucifix, into the craft
of a schemer, was now pouring into the Mohican&#8217;s
ears words emphasizing the glories of martyrdom,
and picturing the bliss which awaited
those who perished for the cause of Mother
Church. The Franciscan and his convert had
withdrawn to a sunny slope a few yards to the
eastward of the flower-strewn hillock upon which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the Brother of the Sun maintained the pomp of
royalty.</p>

<p>Had the eyes and ears of Chat&eacute;muc and
Membr&eacute; been open at that moment to pleasant
impressions, they would have found many sources
of delight in their surroundings. They gazed
upon a multicolored scene whose most striking
features they had never, in their many years of
forest-travel, looked upon before. Bright-hued
flowers, trees gay with the blossoms of spring,
birds whose brilliant plumage suggested the possibility
that a rainbow, shattered into small bits,
had found wings for the remnants of its glory,
and, over all, a blue canopy across which floated
white, fleecy playthings of the breeze, whispered
in vain their story of love and peace to the zealous
friar and his attentive tool.</p>

<p>From the westward came the inspiring shouts
of the home-going multitude and the noise of
kettle-drums helping the army to keep perfect
time as it marched, a snow-white phalanx, toward
the City of the Sun. From their coigne of
vantage Membr&eacute; and the Mohican could see that
a monarch who had snubbed the former and enraged
the latter harbored no present intention of
following his subjects and his army toward his
city. In fact, it soon became apparent that the
Brother of the Sun was about to regale his
guests with a somewhat pretentious feast. Upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
litters, undecorated and simple in construction,
servants belonging to the lowest social caste&mdash;slaves
in fact, if not by law&mdash;bore from the city
food designed to give a substantial foundation to
the Great Sun&#8217;s <i>f&ecirc;te champ&ecirc;tre</i>. Bustling women
brought rudely-constructed wooden benches to
the grass-carpeted banquet-hall whose decorations
were the flowers of spring and whose roof
was the smiling sky.</p>

<p>It was well for the good feeling that de Sancerre
had done so much to strengthen between
the children of the sun and moon that the slaves
made ready the feast with great despatch, for
the inopportune attempt of Zenobe Membr&eacute; to
convert the King at one stroke from the religion
of his ancestors to a faith whose mysteries a
sign-language was impotent to explain had cast
a damper upon the group surrounding royalty.
While it was true that the Great Sun had not
taken offence at the inexplicable demonstration
made by the zealous friar, he had become thoughtful
and silent after the retreat of Membr&eacute; and
the Mohican. To relieve the situation, Henri de
Tonti, a soldier unfitted either by disposition or
habit for delicate feats of diplomacy, made no
effort. Upon his scarred and unsymmetrical
countenance rested an expression of sullen discontent
as he stood, with folded arms, pretending
to watch the preparations for a feast for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
which he had no heart. His jealousy of de
Sancerre increased as he saw that, through the
aid of Noco&#8217;s tongue, the courtier was tempting
back again the smile of friendly interest to the
black-eyed monarch&#8217;s face. Undecided whether
to flee to the hillock where her brother stood or
to place herself in Noco&#8217;s charge, according to
the King&#8217;s command, Katonah lingered irresolutely
by de Sancerre&#8217;s side, while her heart beat
fast with the dread of an impending peril whose
source she could not divine.</p>

<p>Presently the activity of the slaves ceased for
a moment, and the master of ceremonies&mdash;&#8220;<i>le
ma&icirc;tre d&#8217;h&ocirc;tel</i>&#8221; as de Sancerre dubbed him under
his breath&mdash;approached the throne with arms
stretched upward above his head, and announced
in one word that the preparations for the banquet
had been completed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cahani!&#8221; exclaimed the Great Sun, seating
himself upon a bench in front of the royal litter,
and motioning to de Sancerre to take the place
at his right hand. &#8220;Cahani! Sit down!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the monarch&#8217;s left stood Noco, duenna and
interpreter, a useful creature at that moment,
but unfitted by birth to eat meat with her sovereign.
The Brother of the Sun smiled upon Katonah,
and graciously offered her the second place
of honor by his side. What the maiden&#8217;s rank
among the Mohicans might be made no difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
at this juncture. She had been honored by
the Great Sun&#8217;s gracious recognition, and from
that instant was looked up to as a princess by
the ceremonious sun-worshippers, who held that
their monarch&#8217;s nod might serve as a patent of
nobility to a stranger from an alien land. Among
themselves, the road from the lowest social status
to the highest was a hard one. To enter the
circle of the nobility, a low-caste man and wife
among the children of the sun must strangle
one of their own offspring, having proved, by this
heroic sacrifice, their superiority to the humble
rank to which birth had consigned them.</p>

<p>On the royal bench beyond Katonah sat the
restless and dissatisfied de Tonti, silently protesting
against the turn which events had taken,
but just now impotent to change their course.
The Italian veteran had walked far since breaking
his fast, and had undergone the exhausting
conflict of many antagonistic emotions. Hunger
and thirst combined for the moment to postpone
the withdrawal of his followers from the too-hospitable
grasp of the sun-worshippers, but the
observant captain realized the immediate necessity
of a consultation with de la Salle before
proceeding further with negotiations which the
impulsiveness of de Sancerre might twist into
an awkward shape. De Tonti had started out
that morning to visit, he had imagined, an insignificant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
tribe of friendly Indians, and, behold, he
had come upon a powerful nation, equipped with
an army of gigantic warriors and endowed with
a civilization whose outward manifestations were
extremely impressive. Distrustful of de Sancerre,
and knowing well the extremes to which Zenobe
Membr&eacute;&#8217;s zeal as a proselyter might carry him,
the Italian soldier scented danger in their present
environment. He determined, therefore, to
withdraw his followers from the feast at an early
moment, to reject the Great Sun&#8217;s proffer of
hospitality for the night&mdash;which, he felt sure,
would be extended to them&mdash;and to return to
de la Salle&#8217;s camp by the river as quickly as circumstances
permitted.</p>

<p>On the small plateau below the hillock upon
which the Great Sun and his guests sat in state
a hundred dusky noblemen had ranged themselves
along the benches, awaiting, in solemn
silence, the signal from their monarch which
should reawaken the activity of the serving-women
and inaugurate a banquet bidding fair to
last until sundown. The Great Sun had raised his
sceptre of painted feathers to indicate to his master
of ceremonies that the time had come for the
serving of the first course, when the royal eye
lighted upon Zenobe Membr&eacute; and the Mohican,
who still stood upon a hillock beyond the furthest
line of benches, plunged in deep converse.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>&#8220;Go to your friend who sings the praises of
his god, the Moon,&#8221; exclaimed the King, turning
to Noco, who stood behind him awaiting his
pleasure, and pointing his tawdry sceptre toward
the Franciscan, &#8220;and say to him that the
Brother of the Sun invites him to meat and
drink. Have my people make a place for him,
and for his captive who leans upon his voice. Go
quickly, and return to me at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without further delay, the monarch gave the
impatiently-awaited signal for the serving of the
feast, and the hunger of his guests was suddenly
confronted by a throng of antagonists, any one
of which was fashioned to appease, in short order,
the appetite of a European. The coarser meats,
the buffalo steaks and the clumsily cooked venison,
were relieved by fish prepared for the table
with some skill, and by old corn made palatable
in a variety of ways. To Henri de Tonti&#8217;s great
satisfaction, he found that the <i>cuisine</i> of the sun-worshippers
was the most admirable which he
had encountered in his long years of pilgrimages
from one native tribe to another.</p>

<p>It was with a great deal of reluctance that the
Franciscan friar, followed by Chat&eacute;muc, had accepted
the invitation extended to him from the
Great Sun through Noco&#8217;s overworked tongue.
She had delivered her message to the friar in her
mongrel Spanish, and the Franciscan&#8217;s knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
of Latin had enabled him to grasp the general
tenor of her words. He had been endeavoring
to throw upon the embers of the Mohican&#8217;s religious
enthusiasm sufficient fuel to beget a flame
that should result in immediate action of an
heroic nature. But while the Franciscan dwelt
upon the glories of martyrdom and the splendor
of the rewards awaiting a servant of the Church
who gave his life for the faith, fatigue and hunger,
having possessed themselves of Chat&eacute;muc&#8217;s
earthly tabernacle, formed a powerful alliance
against that self-abnegation which the priest
labored earnestly to arouse in the Mohican&#8217;s
soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;To eat meat with these children of Satan,
who worship the very fires of hell, is, I fear, to
commit a grave sin,&#8221; remarked the friar, gazing
upward at Chat&eacute;muc dubiously, as they followed
Noco toward the lower benches. Being a hungry
barbarian, not a devout and learned controversialist,
the Mohican could vouchsafe in answer
to this nothing more satisfactory than a
grunt, a guttural comment upon the delicate
point raised by the agitated friar which might
mean much or nothing.</p>

<p>Seated at the very outskirts of the picturesque
throng, Zenobe Membr&eacute; bent his tonsured head
and told his beads for a time, watching Chat&eacute;muc
furtively as the Mohican indulged freely in roasted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
meats, half-cooked fish, and various preparations
made from last year&#8217;s corn.</p>

<p>&#8220;How proudly yonder temple rises toward
the sky, my Chat&eacute;muc,&#8221; muttered the friar,
glancing toward the City of the Sun. &#8220;Great
will be the glory of the hand chosen by the saints
to pull it to the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chat&eacute;muc chewed a morsel of tough venison
and said nothing, but his eyes rested with a hostile
gleam upon the Great Sun a hundred yards
beyond him, beside whom sat Katonah, seemingly
removed from her brother by the breadth of a
mighty nation. Suddenly by the Mohican&#8217;s side
appeared a serving-woman, who placed upon the
bench at his right hand a gourd containing a fermented
liquor made of the leaves of the cassia-tree.
The increasing loquacity of the banqueters
beyond the friar and his companion proved that
the beverage, which had now reached them, possessed
exhilarating properties. If the Franciscan
had needed further evidence of the enlivening
influence of the seductive liquor, which had come
late to the feast as an ally to good-fellowship,
the change in Chat&eacute;muc&#8217;s face would have offered
it. After emptying his gourd twice&mdash;for the
Mohican liked the cinnamon flavor of the drink&mdash;Chat&eacute;muc,
flashing a glance of hatred at the
Great Sun, looked down at the attentive friar at
his side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>&#8220;The fire of hell shall burn no more beyond,&#8221;
he said, jerking his hand toward the distant city,
behind which the weary sun had begun to creep.
&#8220;The oath I swore to you shall be no idle boast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having observed that the Mohican liked the
wine she offered him, the woman delegated to
serve the friar and his comrade refilled the latter&#8217;s
gourd for the third time. Chat&eacute;muc swallowed
the fiery liquor eagerly, and turned to
speak a final word to the priest.</p>

<p>At that instant Zenobe Membr&eacute;&#8217;s eyes were
fixed upon the royal group beyond him. The
Great Sun had arisen and stood waving his
feathered sceptre energetically, while he gazed
down at Noco, to whom he seemed to be talking
with some excitement. Gazing up at the King,
with a satirical smile upon his delicate face, sat
de Sancerre, while de Tonti had sprung to his
feet with an expression of anger upon his countenance.</p>

<p>When the friar turned to address Chat&eacute;muc,
he discovered that the Mohican had left his side
and had been lost to sight in the long shadows
of the stealthy twilight.</p>

<small>IN WHICH DE SANCERRE RUNS A STUBBORN RACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is but fair to the memory of a noble, if somewhat
too impetuous proselyter, to say that if Zenobe
Membr&eacute;&mdash;whose achievements and sufferings
entitle him to all praise&mdash;had realized that
martyrdom, the rewards for which he had painted
in such glowing colors, really menaced the aroused
Mohican, he would have weighed his words with
greater care. But the gray friar had long been
in the habit of using heroic language to stir the
soul of Chat&eacute;muc to religious enthusiasm, and he
had not, as yet, found cause to regret the use
which he had made for years of his pliable convert.
Furthermore, the Franciscan placed absolute
confidence in the Mohican&#8217;s ability to take
good care of his red skin. He had seen the craft
of Chat&eacute;muc overcome appalling odds too many
times to long indulge the fear that the Indian&#8217;s
sudden disappearance at this juncture presaged
disaster. Nevertheless, he regretted that his convert
had set out upon a mission of some peril
with such unwonted precipitancy. The friar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
would have felt better satisfied with himself if
he had been permitted to breathe a word of caution
into Chat&eacute;muc&#8217;s ear before the latter had
gone forth upon his lonely crusade against the
fires of hell.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the worst,&#8221; muttered the Franciscan to
himself, as he made his way toward the royal
litter between lines of black-eyed, smiling sun-worshippers&mdash;&#8220;at
the worst, it would be one life
for Paradise and a nation for the Church! May
the saints be with my Chat&eacute;muc! If he won a
martyr&#8217;s crown, his blood would quench a fire
which Satan keeps alive. But Mother Mary
aid him! I love him well! I&#8217;d lose my
right hand to save my Chat&eacute;muc from death!
May Christ assail me if so my words were
rash!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus communing with himself, the Franciscan
approached the excited group surrounding
royalty.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, good father, you come to us most opportunely!&#8221;
cried de Sancerre, springing to his
feet, a smile upon his lips but a gleam of repressed
anger in his eyes. &#8220;Monsieur de Tonti
is bent upon repaying his Majesty&#8217;s hospitality
with marked ingratitude. He orders us&mdash;courageous
captain that he is&mdash;to return at once to
Sieur de la Salle. As for me, I have promised
the Brother of the Sun to pass the night in yonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
city&mdash;to the greater glory of our sire, the
moon!&#8221;</p>

<p>Henri de Tonti, a black frown upon his brow,
had overheard the Frenchman&#8217;s sarcastic words.
Seizing the friar by the arm, he flashed a glance
of rage and menace at the exasperating de Sancerre,
and drew the Franciscan aside, to lay before
him weighty arguments in favor of an immediate
retreat to the river.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the younger men among the sun-worshipping
nobility, moved by the same cinnamon-flavored
inspiration which had driven
Chat&eacute;muc toward a Satan-lighted fire, had abandoned
the scene of the recent feast to indulge in
athletic rivalries on the greensward which undulated
gently between the outskirts of the forest
and the City of the Sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you say to his Majesty, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; cried
de Sancerre, gayly, drawing near to the Great
Sun and addressing Noco, &#8220;that he has reason to
be proud of the prowess of his young men? I
have never watched a more exciting wrestling-bout
than yonder struggle between those writhing
giants. It is inspiring! It is classic! Could
Girardon carve a fountain from that Grecian contest
over there, &#8217;twould add another marvel to
Versailles.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Brother of the Sun smiled down upon de
Sancerre with warm cordiality as the aged interpreter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
having caught the general drift of the
Frenchman&#8217;s words, turned his praise into her
native tongue. The monarch&#8217;s momentary annoyance
at Henri de Tonti&#8217;s lack of tact had
passed away, and, standing erect, a right royal
figure on his flower-bedecked dais, he watched,
with unconcealed pride, the skilful feats with
bow-and-arrow performed by the sun-worshipping
aristocrats and the prodigies of strength which
the wrestlers and stone-hurlers accomplished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Do&ntilde;a Noco,&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre
presently, at the conclusion of a closely-contested
foot-race, which even the distraught and restless
Katonah, searching vainly with her eyes for
Chat&eacute;muc, had watched for a moment with bated
breath&mdash;&#8220;tell me the name of yonder greyhound,
carved in bronze, who smiles so disdainfully upon
the victor. I have never before seen a youth
whose legs and shoulders seemed to be so well
fashioned by nature to outstrip the wind itself.
Why does he not compete?&#8221;</p>

<p>The shrivelled crone grinned with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my grandson, Cabanacte,&#8221; she answered,
proudly. &#8220;He&#8217;s now a nobleman, for, at
the risk of life, he bore the spirit of the sun to
us. The whirlwind cannot catch him. The falling-star
seems slow behind his feet. He stands,
in pride, alone; for none dare challenge him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flush crept into the pale face of the Frenchman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
as his sparkling eyes garnered with delight
all the inspiring features of the scene before him,
features which formed at that moment a picture
reminding him of the glory of ancient Athens,
the splendors of a pagan cult which found in
strength and beauty idols worthy of adoring tribute.
The passing day breathed a golden blessing
upon the City of the Sun, which gleamed in
the distance like a dream of Greece in the old,
heroic days. De Sancerre, well-read and impressionable,
mused for a moment upon the strange
likeness of the scene before him to a painting
that he had gazed upon, in a land far over-sea,
representing Attic athletes engaged in classic
games beneath a stately temple behind which the
sun had hid its weary face. Awakening from
his day-dreams, he turned toward Noco and addressed
her in a voice which made his Spanish
most impressive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to Cabanacte, se&ntilde;ora, and say to him
that Count Louis de Sancerre of Languedoc&mdash;the
fairest province in the silver moon&mdash;dares
him to a test of speed, the course to run from
here to yonder lonely tree, near to the city&#8217;s gate,
and back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>A grin of mingled admiration and amazement
lighted the old hag&#8217;s face as she turned toward
the King and repeated to him his guest&#8217;s daring
defiance of a runner whose superiority no sun-worshipper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
had cared to test for many waning
moons. A courteous smile played across the
firm, well-cut mouth of the Great Sun as he listened
to Noco&#8217;s words, but the scornful gleam in
his black eyes as they rested upon the Frenchman&#8217;s
slender, undersized figure was not lost
upon the observant challenger. De Sancerre
realized fully that he had placed in jeopardy his
influence with the Brother of the Sun by risking
a trial of speed with a youth whose fleetness he
had had, as yet, no means of gauging. If he
should be outstripped by Cabanacte the good-will
of the Great Sun would be changed to contempt,
and the relationship of host to guests,
already disturbed by de Tonti&#8217;s lack of tact,
might be transformed into that of a victor to his
captives. What, then, would become of de Sancerre&#8217;s
efforts to solve the mystery to which old
Noco held the key?</p>

<p>But de Sancerre, always self-confident, placed
absolute faith in the elasticity of his light, nervous
frame, whose muscles had been hardened
by his campaigns over-sea and by his wanderings
with de la Salle. No fleeter foot than his had
been found in the sport-loving army of Turenne,
and he had been as much admired in camps for
his agility as at courts for his grace. If, perchance,
he should outrun the stalwart Cabanacte,
de Sancerre felt sure that his easily-won popularity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
with these impressionable sun-worshippers
would be placed upon a much more stable foundation
than its present underpinning of smiles
and courtly bows.</p>

<p>&#8220;My grandson, Cabanacte, sends greeting to
the envoy of the moon,&#8221; panted Noco, returning
speedily to de Sancerre&#8217;s side, &#8220;and will gladly
chase the wind with him in friendly rivalry. He
bids me say that night falls quickly when the
sun has set and that he craves your presence at
this moment on the course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Making a courteous obeisance to the Brother
of the Sun, de Sancerre was about to hasten to
the side of his gigantic adversary, who, stripped
almost to nakedness, stood awaiting his challenger,
when he felt a detaining hand upon his
arm, and, turning petulantly, looked into Katonah&#8217;s
agitated face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chat&eacute;muc! My brother! I cannot see him
anywhere!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear not, <i>ma petite</i>,&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre,
cheerily. &#8220;Wait here until I&#8217;ve made this sun-baked
Mercury imagine he&#8217;s a snail, and we&#8217;ll
find your kinsman of the joyous face. &#8217;Twould
break my heart to lose the gay and smiling
Chat&eacute;muc! Adieu! I go to victory, or, perhaps,
to death! Pray to Saint Maturin for me,
Katonah! He watches over fools!&#8221;</p>

<p>A great shout arose from the sun-worshippers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
as de Sancerre and Cabanacte, saluting each
other with ceremonious respect, stood side by
side awaiting the signal for their flight toward
the distant tree which marked the turning-point
in the course which they were about to run.
The Frenchman, attired in tattered velvets and
wearing shoes never designed for the use of an
athlete, seemed to be at that moment handicapped
by both nature and art for the race awaiting him.
Almost a pygmy beside the bronze giant, whose
limbs would have driven sleep from a sculptor&#8217;s
couch, de Sancerre had apparently chosen well
in asking Katonah for an invocation to the saint
who protects fools from the outcome of their
folly. The black-eyed sun-worshippers glanced
at each other in smiling derision. Surely, these
children of the moon must eat at night of some
plant or fruit which stirred their blood to madness
when they wandered far afield! No dwarf
would dare to measure strides with a colossus unless,
indeed, he&#8217;d lost his wits through midnight
revelry in moonlit glades! This white-faced,
queerly-dressed, and most presumptuous rival of
the mighty Cabanacte might smile and bow and
gain the ear of kings, but look upon him now,
with head bent forward, waiting for the word!
Fragile, petite, thin in the shanks, and with a
chest a boy might scorn, he dares to measure
strides with a sturdy demigod who towers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
above him, a giant shadow in the gloaming
there!</p>

<p>A howl from the overwrought throng shook
the leaves upon the trees. The runners had
sprung from the line at a cry and, elbow to elbow,
were speeding toward the distant tree.
Falling back to Cabanacte&#8217;s flank, de Sancerre,
seeming to grow taller as he ran, and using his
feet with a nimbleness and grace which emphasized
the clumsiness of his fleet rival&#8217;s tread, hung
with ease upon the giant&#8217;s pace, moving with a
rhythmical smoothness which indicated reserved
power. Through the twilight toward the city
rushed the courtier and the savage, made equals
at that moment by the levelling spirit of a manly
sport, while the onlookers stood, eager-eyed and
silent, watching with amazement the pertinacity
of the lithe Frenchman who so stubbornly kept
the pace behind their yet unconquered champion.</p>

<p>As the racers turned the tree marking the half
of their swift career, the dusky patriots saw, with
growing consternation, that the child of moonbeams
still sped gayly along behind the stalwart,
wavering figure of a son of suns. The pace set
by Cabanacte had been heartrending from the
start, for he had cherished the conviction that
he would be able to shake off his puny rival long
before the turn for home was made. But ever
as he strove to increase his lead the bronze-tinted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
athlete heard, just behind his shoulder, the dainty
footfalls of a light-waisted, wiry, bold-hearted
antagonist, who panted not in weariness behind
the champion after the manner of his rivals of
other days. Out of the glowing West came the
racers side by side, every step a contest as they
struggled toward the goal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cabanacte! Cabanacte!&#8221; cried the sun-worshippers,
mad with the fear that the dwarf might
outrun the giant at the last. For the Frenchman
had crept up from behind and was now speeding
homeward on even terms with his delirious, reeling,
wind-blown, but still unconquered rival.
For a hundred yards the racers fought their fight
by inches, each marvelling in his aching mind at
the stern persistence of his antagonist. Then,
when the strain grew greater than human muscles
could endure, the bursting heart of de Sancerre
seemed to ease its awful pressure upon his
chest, his faltering steps regained their light and
graceful motion, and, passing Cabanacte as the
latter glanced up with eyes bloodshot with longing,
the Frenchman, with a gay smile upon his
pallid face, rushed past the line, a winner of the
race by two full yards.</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;THE FRENCHMAN, WITH A GAY SMILE UPON HIS PALLID FACE, RUSHED<br />
PAST THE LINE, A WINNER OF THE RACE BY TWO FULL YARDS&#8221;</p>

<p>The hot, generous blood of the sun-worshippers
bounded in their veins as they seized the tottering
victor and, with shouts of wonder and acclaim,
raised him to their shoulders and bore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
him, a wonder-worker in their eyes, to the smiling
presence of their astonished king. But before
de Sancerre could receive the congratulations
of the Brother of the Sun, the voice of
Katonah had reached him over the heads of the
excited patricians.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; cried the Mohican maiden, in
French, her voice vibrating with excitement,
&#8220;P&egrave;re Membr&eacute; and Monsieur de Tonti have
set out for the camp, and Chat&eacute;muc has not
returned!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Peste, ma petite!</i>&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre,
blowing her a kiss over the turmoil of black
heads beneath him. &#8220;Why trouble me with
trifles such as these? See you not that a splinter
from a moonbeam has put the sun to shame&mdash;to
the greater glory of our Mother Church.
<i>Laude, Katonah! Laude et jubilate!</i>&#8221;</p>

<small>IN WHICH THE RESULTS OF CHAT&Eacute;MUC&#8217;S ENTHUSIASM<br />
ARE SEEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Courage,</span> <i>ma petite</i>! We&#8217;ll find your Chat&eacute;muc;
then learn the mysteries of yonder sun-kissed
town. That the stubborn captain has
deserted us is hardly strange. Always in fear
of de la Salle&#8217;s displeasure, Monsieur de Tonti
has grown erratic, unreliable, jealous. As for
the friar, his retreat surprises me. He lacks not
courage nor persistence. He would not leave
our brother of the sun without, at the least, one
more attempt to show him the path which leads
to Mother Church.&#8221;</p>

<p>Released from the enthusiastic arms of the
noblemen who had carried him in triumph to
their king, de Sancerre was now following the
royal litter toward the City of the Sun, walking
the well-beaten path with the mincing step of a
courtier whose feet, though swifter than the
winds, pay homage gayly to Grace as a worthier
deity than Speed. On either side of the victorious
runner, whose eyes still glowed with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
joy of triumph, walked Noco and Katonah. The
latter, downcast and apprehensive, gazed gloomily
toward the city, whose roofs could now be
plainly seen, while she listened apathetically to
the Frenchman&#8217;s encouraging words. Changing
the tongue he used from French to Spanish, de
Sancerre, turning toward Noco, who looked, in
the twilight, like a hideous heathen idol carved
in mahogany, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust, se&ntilde;ora, that your courageous grandson,
my very worthy opponent, will bear me no
ill-will because my slender body was less a burden
than his giant frame.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noco, to whom de Sancerre&#8217;s overthrow of
the erstwhile invincible Cabanacte had appeared
like a miracle wrought by some mysterious moon-magic,
gazed reverentially at the Frenchman with
beady, black eyes, which seemed to be fully half
a century younger than the other features of her
wrinkled face. Her countenance was a palimpsest,
with youth staring out from beneath the
writings made by time.</p>

<p>&#8220;My grandson, Cabanacte, O Son of the Full
Moon, will ever do your bidding with a loyal
heart. According to the customs of our land,
your triumph in the race entitles you to service
at his hands until his feet wax swift enough to
fly away from yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caramba!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
expletives bore testimony to the cosmopolitan
tendencies of his adventurous career, &#8220;your words,
se&ntilde;ora, rejoice my heart! I stand in sore need
of a servitor to save me from the nakedness which
one more heated foot-race would beget. If Cabanacte
can repair the rents which make my costume
such a marvel to the eye, I&#8217;ll free him from
his <i>villein socage</i> and make him proud again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Enough of this the old hag understood&mdash;enlightened,
to a great extent, by the Frenchman&#8217;s
eloquent gestures&mdash;to emphasize the grin upon
her ugly but intelligent face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cabanacte is a warrior, not a maker of flowing
robes!&#8221; she exclaimed, with a raucous chuckle.
&#8220;But to-night old Noco will repair the holes in
the Son of the Full Moon&#8217;s garb. Look at this.&#8221;
Fumbling at her waist, she presently held out to
de Sancerre&#8217;s gaze a needle made of fish-bone.
Lowering her voice, she said: &#8220;Coyocop, the
spirit of the sun, has not disdained to let my
needle prick her sacred dress. She weeps, and
cares for nothing but to lie upon her couch and
whisper secrets to the mother of the sun. &#8217;Tis
sad, but so she must fulfil her mission to our
race. Our nation&#8217;s wise men and the priests who
tend the temple-fire had told us she would come.
My grandson, Cabanacte, bore her from the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre listened attentively to the old
crone&#8217;s words. He recalled Noco&#8217;s assertion that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Coyocop had scrawled his inamorata&#8217;s name upon
the mulberry bark, though, at the time, he had
not grasped the full significance of her mumbled,
mongrel Spanish words, rendered less clear to
him by the use of the meaningless name, Coyocop.
But now, as they hurried on behind the
porters who carried the King&#8217;s litter, followed
by a hundred chattering noblemen, a veil seemed
to be lifted from de Sancerre&#8217;s mind. His heart
beat with suffocating rapidity, and his voice trembled
as he looked down at Noco, trying to catch
her eyes in the darkening twilight, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas Coyocop who scratched that name
upon the bark? But why, good Do&ntilde;a Noco?
Tell me why.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman glanced over her shoulder, to
assure herself that they could not be overheard.
Then she whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her the white-faced children of the
moon had come to us upon the bosom of the
flood, according to an ancient prophecy. The
temple priests would strangle me with cords if
they should learn how my old tongue has wagged.
They watch me closely, for they worship her.
But once she found a moment, when no priest
was near, to scratch the mystic symbols on the
bark. I crept away at night and, lo, your god,
the moon, was guide to my old feet&mdash;and, so, I
came to you from Coyocop.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>That Noco had told him all she had to tell, the
Frenchman did not for a moment doubt. But,
even then, she had thrown little light upon the
mystery which confronted him. A mondain to
his finger-tips, at heart a sceptic, de Sancerre
fostered no belief in miracles. Surrounded, as
he had been all the days of his life, by men and
women steeped in superstition, his spirit had revolted
at the impostures which had served to
blind mankind through centuries of human history.
Had de Sancerre been wrought of the stuff
of which his age was made, he would have reached
the conclusion at once that here in the wilderness
the avenging spirit of the Spaniard whom he
had slain in France was haunting him at night to
play him tricks to drive him straight to madness.
&#8217;Twould be so easy to account thus for what his
reason could not now explain. But de Sancerre
was a man who, intellectually, had pressed on in
advance of his times. By policy a conformist to
the exterior demands of his avowed religion, he
had long lost his faith in the active interference
in earthly affairs of saints and devils. How the
name of Julia de Aquilar had found its way to a
piece of vagrom bark in a wilderness, thousands
of miles across the sea from the land of her
nativity, he could not explain, nor could he harbor,
for an instant, the wild idea that Coyocop
and his inamorata would prove to be identical.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
In spite of the malicious horns of his dilemma,
nevertheless, he eliminated from his thoughts
the possibility that he had become the plaything
of supernatural agencies. But who was
Coyocop? He must look upon her face without
delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;ora, listen!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre, seizing
Noco by the arm. &#8220;I must see the spirit of
the sun to-night! From the mountains of the
moon, where reigns our god in silvery state, I
bear a message to the goddess Coyocop. <i>Peste</i>,
Do&ntilde;a Noco! Have you gone to sleep?&#8221; He
shook her gently, striving hard to find her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It cannot be,&#8221; muttered the old crone, trembling
under his grasp as if the night wind chilled
her time-worn frame&mdash;&#8220;it cannot be. &#8217;Twould
mean your life&mdash;and mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold, se&ntilde;ora! Remember Cabanacte&mdash;and
pin your faith to me! No matter what the odds
may be, the brother of the moonbeams always
wins! Bear that in mind, good Noco, or the
future may grow black for thee. Be faithful to
my fortunes&mdash;and I&#8217;ll make your grandson noble
once again.&#8221;</p>

<p>How deep an impression his words had made
upon the beldame, de Sancerre could not tell, for
at that moment there arose behind him a weird
chant, sung by a hundred tuneful voices, rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
and falling upon the evening air with thrilling
effect. Suddenly beyond them from the very
heart of the City of the Sun arose a mightier
chorus than the King&#8217;s suite could beget, and the
night grew vibrant with a wild, menacing song
which chilled de Sancerre&#8217;s heart and caused
Katonah to press close to his side, in vain striving
for the comfort she could not find.</p>

<p>Presently the litter of the King, passing between
two outlying houses, turned into a broad
avenue which led directly to the great square of
the city, at one side of which stood the temple
of the sun. The moon had not yet arisen, and
what was twilight in the open had turned to
night within the confines of the town. De Sancerre,
who was a close observer, both by temperament
and by habit, strove in vain to obtain a
satisfactory view of the dwelling-houses between
which the royal litter passed. But when the
King and his followers had reached the outskirts
of the great square, the Frenchman forgot at once
his curiosity as a traveller; forgot, even for a
moment, the problem to solve which he had dared
to enter this pagan city, in defiance of all discipline
and in direct disobedience to La Salle&#8217;s lieutenant.
The scene which broke upon his staring
eyes stilled, for an instant, the beating of his
heart, which seemed to bound into his throat to
choke him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>The square between the King&#8217;s litter and the
entrance to the temple was thronged with men
and women, in front of whom stood long lines of
stalwart warriors, the flower of the army which
had recently astonished the eyes of the wanderers
from over-sea. Waving lights and shadows, the
quarrelsome offspring of flaring torches, changed
constantly the grim details of the scene, as if the
night wind strove to hide the horrors of a dancing,
evil dream.</p>

<p>Directly in front of the main entrance to the
temple of the sun-worshippers stood a post to
which Chat&eacute;muc had been tied by cords. On
either side of him white-robed priests, wielding
long wooden rods, the ends of which had been
turned to red coals in the sacred fire, prodded his
hissing flesh, while they sang a chant of devilish
triumph, in which the populace, enraged at the
sacrilege attempted by the Mohican, joined at
intervals.</p>

<p>Facing the dying martyr, who gazed down at
him with proud stoicism, knelt the gray-frocked
Franciscan, Zenobe Membr&eacute;, holding toward the
victim of excessive zeal the crude crucifix, for
love of which Chat&eacute;muc, the Mohican, was now
freeing his soul from torment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nom de Dieu!&#8221; cried de Sancerre, placing
his hand upon his rapier, &#8220;this savage sport must
end!&#8221; In another instant the reckless Frenchman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
carving his way to death, would have challenged
an army, single-handed, had not Katonah,
reeling from the horror of her brother&#8217;s death,
fallen senseless into his reluctant arms.</p>

<small>IN WHICH THE GRAY FRIAR DONS THE LIVERY OF<br />
SATAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">It</span> was a miracle! A voice from heaven
whispered in my ear, and, turning back, I left
de Tonti, angry, threatening, to take his way
alone. To give my Chat&eacute;muc the words of absolution
at the last, the Virgin Mother led me by
the hand. And now in Paradise he wears a
martyr&#8217;s crown. The saints be praised!&#8221;</p>

<p>The earnest eyes of the Franciscan were turned
upward in an ecstasy of gratitude and devotion.
Seated upon a wooden bench by the gray friar&#8217;s
side, de Sancerre listened musingly to Membr&eacute;&#8217;s
account of the Italian captain&#8217;s attempt to entice
him back to de la Salle&#8217;s camp before he had
learned the outcome of Chat&eacute;muc&#8217;s effort to extinguish
a flame from hell.</p>

<p>Noco, well understanding the present temper
of the sun-worshipping priesthood, and acting
upon a command given to her by the Great Sun
himself, had managed, with considerable difficulty,
to persuade de Sancerre and Katonah to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
secrete themselves for a time in her unpretentious
but not comfortless hut. Her rescue of Zenobe
Membr&eacute; from his threatening environment at the
martyred Mohican&#8217;s side had been, she flattered
herself, a triumph of adroitness, and she sat in a
dark corner of the room at this moment whispering
to her gigantic grandson. Cabanacte, warm
praise of her own cleverness. She had saved
the Franciscan from the immediate vengeance
of the sun-worshipping priests by suggesting to
the latter that the summary execution of the
gray-frocked singer of unorthodox chants might
arouse the anger of Coyocop, whose coming,
prophecy had told them, was connected, in some
occult way, with the predicted advent of the
white-faced envoys from the moon. Sated with
the cruel entertainment vouchsafed to them by
the death-twitchings of the stoical Chat&eacute;muc, the
white-robed guardians of the sun-temple had
permitted the Franciscan to depart with Noco,
although the latter well knew that thenceforth
every movement which she and her gray-garbed
companion made would be noted by the dark
eyes of fanatical spies.</p>

<p>The room in which the refugees&mdash;for such the
antagonism of the dominant sun-priests had made
them&mdash;had found shelter for the night was a
picturesque apartment, fifteen feet in length and
breadth, and lighted by flickering gleams from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
the embers of a fire of walnut-wood. Upon a
bed of plaited reeds, resting upon a wooden
frame two feet high, lay Katonah, grief-stricken,
motionless, making no sound. Heart-broken at
her brother&#8217;s awful fate, the Indian maiden
nursed her sorrow in loneliness and silence. In
vain had the good friar attempted to console her
for her irreparable loss by painting, in eloquent
words, the rewards awaiting a martyr who died
for love of Mother Church. Katonah was too
recent a convert to the Franciscan&#8217;s faith to
realize and rejoice in the unseen glories of her
brother&#8217;s heroic self-sacrifice. She had listened to
Membr&eacute;&#8217;s soothing words with a grateful smile
upon her strong, symmetrical face, but evident
relief had come to her when the gray-frocked enthusiast
had retired from her bedside to seat himself
beside de Sancerre in the centre of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardieu!&#8221; muttered the Frenchman, casting
a searching glance at the corner in which Noco
and Cabanacte were engaged in earnest, low-voiced
converse, &#8220;these people show outward
signs of enlightenment, but they have a most
brutal way of putting a man to death. The
savage delight which those white-robed devils
seemed to take in basting poor Chat&eacute;muc made
my sword-point itch. &#8217;Twas well for me Saint
Maturin was kind. He checked my folly just in
time! But listen, father! The martyrdom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Chat&eacute;muc must now suffice. Those imps of hell
will have your life, anon, unless you foil their
craft by craft. I think I hear their stealthy footsteps
menacing these sun-cooked walls and making
challenge of our god, the moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Franciscan put up his hand to enforce silence
that he might listen to the furtive footfalls
outside the hut. At that moment Noco and her
grandson stole toward the centre of the room.
The stalwart sun-worshipper, who now looked
upon de Sancerre as a supernatural being worthy
of the most reverential treatment, towered aloft
in the narrow chamber like a keen-eyed, sun-burnt
ogre who had lured a number of unlucky dwarfs
to his den to have his grim way with them.
Stretching his long body at full length before the
sputtering fire, Cabanacte turned his admiring
gaze toward the troubled face of his fleet-footed
conqueror and waited for Noco to put into words
the thoughts which fretted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;all of you&mdash;must leave here to-night,
se&ntilde;or,&#8221; said the old woman in a guttural whisper.
&#8220;The Brother of the Sun is your friend, but the
priests of the temple look with suspicion upon
you and the gray chanter. They would not dare
to defy openly the King, but they have tracked
you to this hiding-place and will work you mischief
if they may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, se&ntilde;ora, I fear them not!&#8221; exclaimed de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Sancerre, drawing his rapier and allowing the
fire-flashes to gleam along the steel. &#8220;Saving
the father&#8217;s presence here, one sword against a
priesthood is enough. My tongue&#8217;s as boastful
as a Gascon&#8217;s, is it not? But list to this, se&ntilde;ora!
I leave here only when I&#8217;ve had some speech
with Coyocop, the spirit of the sun. When that
may be I do not know, but Louis de Sancerre, a
moonbeam&#8217;s eldest son, has sworn an oath&mdash;and
so, se&ntilde;ora, my welcome I must stretch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cabanacte, who had learned a little distorted
Spanish from his loquacious grandparent, had
caught the drift of the Frenchman&#8217;s speech. Putting
forth a large, brown hand, shapely in its
massiveness, he touched the buckles upon de Sancerre&#8217;s
shoes and exclaimed, in what sounded
like a parody upon Noco&#8217;s rendition of an alien
tongue:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Good! The son of moonbeams has a
lofty soul! And Cabanacte is his body-guard!
No harm shall come to you, despite the oath our
priests have sworn!&#8221;</p>

<p>The smile upon de Sancerre&#8217;s ever-changing
face was the visible sign of varied emotions.
Pleased at the cordial proffer of Cabanacte&#8217;s
friendship, the Frenchman was astonished to discover
that the giant had picked up a Spanish
vocabulary which, in spite of his peculiar pronunciation,
was not wholly useless. That the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
survival of a Spanish <i>patois</i> among these sun-worshippers
suggested a pathetic page of unwritten
history de Sancerre realized, but his
mind at that moment was too disturbed to linger
long over an ethnological and linguistic problem.
Turning to face the Franciscan friar, he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;P&egrave;re Membr&eacute;, these pagan priests seek vengeance
upon you. They have no reason yet for
hating me, a splinter from a moonbeam who
makes no open war against their creed. But,
for the cause of Mother Church, we must lure
them from their grim idolatry. Let Cabanacte
use his strength and wits to find a pathway leading
to our camp by which you may return. Here
I shall stay until our leader, coming North again,
shall send me word to quit this place, leaving
behind me a friendly race, soil ready for the
seeds of living truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not excessive self-laudation which had
led de Sancerre to believe that he possessed the
qualifications essential to success in diplomacy.
Whenever he had set out to effect a purpose
seemingly worthy of studied effort, he had found
no difficulty in checking the satirical tendencies
of his flippant tongue. At this moment he was
gazing at the Franciscan&#8217;s disturbed countenance
with eyes which seemed to gleam with the fervor
of his zeal for Mother Church. Wishing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
convince P&egrave;re Membr&eacute; that the ultimate conversion
of these pagans from their worship of hell-fire
to the true faith depended upon their possession
of a hostage who should study their
manners and customs and learn the shortest path
by which their unregenerated souls might be
reached, de Sancerre explained his plan of action
to the friar with an unctuous fervor which
convinced the latter that he had underestimated
the errant courtier&#8217;s enthusiasm as a proselyter.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Mohican maiden, monsieur? I owe
it to Chat&eacute;muc, the martyr, now with the saints
in Paradise, to place her in the care of de la
Salle. His sword, my crucifix, must guard Katonah
for her brother&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>The walnut embers in the clumsy fireplace had
grown black and cold. For some time past no
sound had reached the ears of the schemers from
the menacing environment outside the hut. The
moon had touched its midnight goal, and sought,
in passing, to probe the secrets of old Noco&#8217;s
home.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bonnement!</i>&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre. &#8220;Go
to her at once, good father, and tell her that &#8217;tis
best she should return with you to-night. I&#8217;ll
join you presently. Meanwhile, I must have
further speech with Noco and her grandson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently the moonbeams, which had stolen
into the hut through chinks between the timbers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
and the hardened mud, threw a dim light upon
a most impressive tableau. The white face of
the Frenchman was bent close to the dusky visage
of the athletic sun-worshipper, while Noco,
squatting upon the ground, bent toward them her
wrinkled, grinning countenance, an effigy of
&#8220;Gossip,&#8221; wrought in bronze. Bending over the
reed-made couch upon which Katonah, dumb
with misery, lay listening, stood the gray friar,
whispering to the phlegmatic and seemingly
obedient maiden the Frenchman&#8217;s late behest.</p>

<p>Before the moonbeams could take their tale
abroad, the scene had changed. From a corner
of the hut Noco had brought to the Franciscan
and his charge flowing garments of white mulberry bark,
in which Katonah and the friar reluctantly
enrobed themselves. With a harmless
dye, old Noco, whose time-tested frame seemed
to defy fatigue, deftly changed the protesting
Membr&eacute;&#8217;s white complexion to light mahogany.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother of Mary! I fear me this is sacrilege,&#8221;
muttered the friar, nervously seeking his breviary
beneath the white uniform of a lost sun-worshipper.
&#8220;<i>Satis, superque!</i> You&#8217;ll make my face,
old woman, as black as Satan&#8217;s heart! The
saints forgive me! Were not my life of value to
the Church, I&#8217;d gladly die before I&#8217;d don this
ghostly livery of sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile de Sancerre had been straining his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
weary eyes in the effort to scratch a message to
de la Salle with his dagger&#8217;s-point upon a slip of
white bark.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Spanish have tampered with a mighty
nation,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;I remain to learn the truth;
to find a way to win them to our king. Camp
where you are when you return. I&#8217;ll learn of
your approach, rejoin you then, and bring you
news most worthy your concern. <i>Au revoir,
mon capitaine!</i> For France, with sword and
crucifix!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he scrawled his signature beneath these
words, Katonah glided silently to his side, a
maiden whose grace was not destroyed by her
unwonted garb, a costume enhancing the dark
beauty of her proud, melancholy face. Her
light hand rested gently upon his arm for a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;The good father tells me that you would have
me go,&#8221; she murmured in a voice of mingled resignation
and regret. De Sancerre, handing her
the slip of mulberry bark upon which he had
scratched a message to his leader, smiled up into
the yearning face of the lonely girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give this to our captain, Sieur de la Salle,&#8221;
he said, sharply. &#8220;Fail not, Katonah! My life,
I think, depends upon this scrawl.&#8221;</p>

<p>A smile flashed across the maiden&#8217;s mournful
face as she pressed the bark to her bosom, heaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
with a conflict of emotions to which no words
of hers could give relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;His hand shall hold it ere the sun is up,&#8221; she
said, simply. &#8220;Farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre, looking up into the girl&#8217;s eyes
felt, with amazement, the tears creeping into his.
He bent his head and imprinted a kiss upon her
slender, trembling hand, which felt like ice beneath
his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Courage, <i>ma petite</i>!&#8221; he cried, with forced
gayety. &#8220;You will return anon! And then,
the river once again, and home&mdash;and friends&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice broke, and when he had regained
his self-control he saw that Katonah had joined
Cabanacte and the friar at the entrance to the
hut.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>IN WHICH A SPIRIT SAVES DE SANCERRE FROM DEATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> reigned in Noco&#8217;s hut intense silence.
Stretched upon a bench in the centre of the room
lay de Sancerre, his head bent forward and his
eyes agleam, while he listened apprehensively to
the murmurs of the night outside. On the
ground at his feet squatted his aged hostess,
quick to interpret every sound which echoed
from the sleeping town. Her eyes still burned
with the light of her marvellous vitality, but her
present posture indicated that her old bones had
grown weary of the friction begotten by a long
and exacting day.</p>

<p>&#8220;All is well, se&ntilde;ora? You hear no threatening
sound?&#8221; De Sancerre&#8217;s voice bore witness to
the excitement under which he labored at that
crucial moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;A dog barks, near at hand; an owl hoots, far
away. Our friends are safe beyond the town&mdash;and
all is well!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bien!</i> Do&ntilde;a Noco, I trust the keenness of
your ears. I feared the searching gaze of wakeful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
spies. &#8217;Tis possible your priests have gone to
sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old hag grinned. &#8220;Make no mistake,&#8221;
she exclaimed, in her broken Spanish. &#8220;Their
eyes have seen your people, but, fearing Cabanacte&#8217;s
wrath, they dared not search beneath the
white robes at his side. Within the temple chattering
priests will ask each other whom my
grandson guides. They&#8217;ll ask in vain! But,
hark! The night&#8217;s as quiet as a sleeping babe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, when I&#8217;m in the mood, I&#8217;ll vow a candle
to St. Raphael,&#8221; cried de Sancerre, lightly.
&#8220;He travelled safe by wearing a disguise! But
tell me, Do&ntilde;a Noco, is the coast now clear? I&#8217;ve
set my heart upon a look at Coyocop&#8217;s abode. I
cannot sleep until I know where this fair spirit
of the sun is lodged.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beldame&#8217;s black eyes flashed with excitement.
Her overwrought frame seemed to renew
its vigor as she arose to her feet and hurried toward
the low-cut entrance to the hut. An instant
later, de Sancerre found himself the solitary occupant
of a dreary and disordered room. He
peered through the shadows toward the exit
through which Noco had passed and, for a moment,
doubt of her good faith entered his mind.
He fully comprehended the perils of his environment,
and realized that upon the loyalty of the
old hag who had just left his side depended his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
escape from the dangers which beset him. While
it might be that he, an envoy from the moon,
helped to fulfil an ancient prophecy in which
these fickle sun-worshippers put faith, the fact
remained that their chief, the Great Sun, had
failed to give him countenance before the temple
priests. It had become painfully apparent to de
Sancerre that the real centre of authority in this
land of superstitions was to be looked for near
the sacred fire and not at the King&#8217;s throne.
The fact that the Brother of the Sun had found
it inexpedient to lodge the Frenchman in the
royal residence bore testimony to the strong ties
which bound the palace to the temple, to the
close relationship of church and state. To a man
who had spent years at Versailles, the influence
exerted by a priesthood upon a king was not a
marvel.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi!</i>&#8221; muttered de Sancerre to himself,
as he rested his aching head upon his hand and
watched expectantly the hole in the wall through
which Noco had departed. &#8220;The old finesse
which served me well at courts has worn itself to
naught. In France or in this wilderness my
fate&#8217;s the same. I jump to favor&mdash;then the King
grows cold and potent priests usurp the place I
held. But, even so, the tale is not all told. I&#8217;m
here to solve a puzzle, not to fawn upon a prince
nor tempt the vengeance of a temple&#8217;s brood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
So be that Noco&#8217;s true, I yet may work my will
upon a stubborn mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment a hideous grin, weird offspring
of ivory and bronze, rewarded de Sancerre&#8217;s
straining gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; whispered Noco through
the hole which served as a door to the hut.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no one in the city now awake save nodding
priests who feed the fire with logs. I&#8217;ll
show you in the moonlight where Coyocop&#8217;s at
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the white light of a cloudless night the City
of the Sun lay disguised in a beauty which the
bright glare of its own deity destroyed by day.
Grouped around the temple, the houses of the
sun-worshippers, rising gracefully from artificial
mounds, were softened in their outlines by the
moonbeams until they formed a city upon which
de Sancerre, accustomed, as he was, to the architectural
splendors of the old world, gazed with
surprise and pleasure. Choosing the shadows
cast by the sun-baked walls for her pathway,
Noco led the stranger past the most pretentious
building in the town, the sacred temple in which
a mystic fire was ever kept alive. Like an
earthen oven, one hundred feet in circumference,
the stronghold of a cruel priesthood impressed
the Frenchman with its grim significance. As
he and his withered guide crept noiselessly past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
the silent, shadow-haunted fane, de Sancerre succumbed
to a shudder which he could not readily
control. Upon a palisade above his head,
surrounding the temple upon all sides, skulls
gleamed in the moonlight, bearing sombre witness
to the horrors of the cult by which a noble
race was brutalized.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dios!</i>&#8221; he muttered in the old hag&#8217;s ear, as he
clasped her by the arm. &#8220;The shambles of your
creed offend my sight! If you love me, se&ntilde;ora,
we&#8217;ll leave this place behind!&#8221;</p>

<p>They had not far to go. Beyond the temple
and facing the east stood the spacious cabin in
which the Brother of the Sun maintained his
royal state. It was silent and deserted as they
stole by it, to take their stand in the shadow cast
by a house proud of its nearness to the home of
kings. White and silent, the night recalled to
de Sancerre&#8217;s mind an evening in the outskirts of
Versailles when, having eluded the watchful eyes
of his Spanish rival, he had tempted Do&ntilde;a Julia
de Aquilar to a stroll beneath the moon. His
heart grew sick with the sweetness of his revery.
He could see again the dark, liquid eyes, the raven
hair, the pale, perfect face of a woman whose
splendid beauty mocked him now as he stood
there a waif, blown by the cruel winds of misfortune
to a land where grinning skulls stared
down at him at night, as if they&#8217;d heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
story of his lost love and rejoiced at his cruel
plight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come! Come, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; he murmured, fretfully,
turning to retrace his steps, and seemingly
forgetful of the object of his perilous pilgrimage.
&#8220;Come! Let us go back!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, se&ntilde;or! Listen!&#8221; whispered the old
crone, hoarsely, pulling him closer toward the
house in the shadow of which they lingered.
&#8220;Listen! &#8217;Tis Coyocop!&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre leaned against the wall of the
hut, made dizzy for a moment by the wild
beating of his heart. In perfect harmony with
the melancholy beauty of the night arose a sad,
soft, sweet-toned voice, which came to him at
that moment like a caress bestowed upon him in
a dream and made real by a miracle. De Sancerre
clutched old Noco&#8217;s arm with a grasp which
made her wince. Gazing at the moon-kissed
scene before him with eyes which saw only a
picture of the past he listened, white-lipped,
breathless, trembling, to an old Spanish song,
into which Juan Fernandez Heredia, more than
a century before this night, had breathed the
passion and the melancholy of a romantic race.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>A sob set to music, despair turned into song, a
voice telling of unshed tears echoed through the
night and gave way to silence for a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> Do I dream, or am I going
mad?&#8221; muttered de Sancerre to himself, peering
down at his silent companion as if seeking an
answer to the questions that beset him. Suddenly
the voice, whose tones spoke to his heart
in the only language known to all the world,
again made music out of misery:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">
&#8220;There is a wound that never heals&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">&#8217;Tis folly e&#8217;en to dream of healing;</div>
<div class="verse">Inquire not what a spirit feels</div>
<div class="indent">That aye has lost the sense of feeling.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;My heart is callous now, and bared</div>
<div class="indent">To every pang with sorrow fraught;</div>
<div class="verse">The pain of death itself, compared</div>
<div class="indent">To this, is hardly worth a thought.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The song gave way to silence, and, drawing himself
erect, like a man who awakens from a trance,
de Sancerre turned to Noco:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the spirit of the sun,&#8221; whispered the old
crone. &#8220;&#8217;Tis Coyocop. She sings at night the
songs we cannot understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; muttered the Frenchman,
striving to check the impetuosity which tempted
him to defy the perils surrounding him and to
enter the hut without more ado. &#8220;&#8217;Tis the spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
of the sun&mdash;of life and hope and love! I worship
her, se&ntilde;ora. By what astounding chance&mdash; But
let that pass! Do&ntilde;a Noco, you must speak
to Coyocop at once. Tell her&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre&#8217;s words died upon his lips, for the
wiry old hag had dragged him by the arm around
a corner of the cabin before he could end his
sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;A priest of the
temple has come this way to listen to the spirit&#8217;s
voice. &#8217;Tis well for us that my old eyes are
quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not heeding the angry protests of the Frenchman,
whose longing to send a word of greeting
to a singer whose voice seemed to have reached
him from a land far over-sea was driving him to
desperate deeds, Noco led de Sancerre rapidly,
by a circuitous path they had not trod before,
toward the quarter of the sleeping town in which
her hut awaited them. Beneath the ghastly sentinels
grinning down at them from the temple&#8217;s
palisades they stole for a space, and then turned
to pick their way toward Noco&#8217;s home behind
cabins which cast long shadows toward the east.</p>

<p>Stepping from the gloom into the moonlight,
Noco, holding the Frenchman like a captive by
the arm, was about to enter her hut with her rebellious
guest when there arose around them, as
if the earth had suddenly given birth to a night-prowling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
priesthood, the white-robed figures of a
score of silent men.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have we here?&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre,
breaking away from Noco&#8217;s clutch, and drawing
his rapier from its sheath. &#8220;My sword is
fond of moonlight! Ask these ghostly cowards,
se&ntilde;ora, how they dare to dog the footsteps of
the Brother of the Moon. Just say to them
that in this blood-stained blade there&#8217;s magic,
made of silver-dust, to kill a thousand men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be silent, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; implored Noco. &#8220;I&#8217;ll save
you, if I can.&#8221; Then, facing the chief priest,
who towered above them a few paces in front of
his silent and motionless brethren, she exclaimed,
in the tongue of the sun-worshippers:</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you with this scion of the moon?
He worships Coyocop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How know we that?&#8221; asked the chief priest,
sternly, a bronze giant questioning a bronze
dwarf surrounded by sentinels of bronze. In
the very centre of the dusky, white-garbed
group stood the pale, desperate Frenchman, his
rapier pointed at an angle toward the ground,
while his keen eyes, bold and unflinching, travelled
defiantly from face to face of the scowling
priests.</p>

<p>&#8220;What says the Inquisition? Will they dare
the terrors of my hungry blade, se&ntilde;ora?&#8221; cried
de Sancerre, mockingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis dread of the gray chanter that inspires
them,&#8221; muttered Noco. Then she turned to the
Frenchman. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told them that you worship
Coyocop. They have no proof of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardieu!&#8221; exclaimed the Frenchman, elevating
his rapier. &#8220;The blood of a sulky Spaniard
on this blade is proof enough. But, I have it!
Say to his holiness, the chief priest, that I will
scratch a message to the spirit of the sun upon a
piece of bark. Bid him, in person, take it straight
to Coyocop. If he obeys not what she says to
him, the City of the Sun is doomed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly translating de Sancerre&#8217;s defiant words
into her native tongue, Noco, at a gesture from
the chief priest, entered her hut. She was absent
but a moment and, upon her return, handed a
piece of virgin mulberry-wood to de Sancerre.
Drawing his dagger from its sheath, the Frenchman
scrawled these words upon the white bark:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Louis de Sancerre, of Languedoc, sends greeting to Coyocop.
Warn the bearer that my person must be sacred in the
City of the Sun. To-morrow I will speak to you the words I
cannot write.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Noco, without more ado, handed the note to
the guardian of the sacred fire, who received
it with evident reluctance. Ignorant of the art
of writing, he looked upon the gleaming bark as
a bit of moon-magic which might, at any moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
cast upon him an evil spell. But, for the sake of
his prestige with his order, he dared not give way
to the dread which filled his superstitious soul.
Stalking away, with Noco hurrying on behind
him, he strode through the moonlight toward
the house in which the spirit of the sun was
lodged.</p>

<p>The minutes which preceded his return were
like weary hours to the distraught Frenchman,
surrounded, as he was, by pitiless faces from
which black, piercing eyes seemed to singe his
velvets with their spiteful gleams. A tattered
courtier, with drawn sword, he stood there motionless,
silent, awaiting with foreboding the
return of his most influential foe. If fancy, or
a fever begotten of a long and exciting day, had
played him a trick; if the song of Coyocop had
been voiced by Julia de Aquilar only in his
imagination, he knew that he was doomed.
Presently he drew from his bosom the piece of
bark upon which was written the Spanish maiden&#8217;s
name. The sight revived his drooping
courage. Whatever might be the explanation
of the presence of Julia de Aquilar in this grim
outland, his reason told him that his eyes and
ears had not deceived him.</p>

<p>At that moment the chief priest, breaking
through the circle of his subordinates, strode
quickly toward de Sancerre. Falling upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
knees, he raised his long arms toward the sky
and uttered a harsh shout which was repeated
by the onlooking priests.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are saved!&#8221; whispered the panting Noco,
an instant later, to the Frenchman. &#8220;Coyocop
has rescued you from death!&#8221;</p>

<p>Having paid homage to the misunderstood
scion of the moon, the guardian of the sacred
fire handed to de Sancerre the bark, within
which the former had found no evil spell.
Scrawled beneath the Frenchman&#8217;s words were
these:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The Holy Mother has heard my prayers. All glory be
to her for this strange miracle. I await your coming with a
grateful heart. No harm can fall upon you, for I have
warned the temple priest. May the saints guard you through
the night.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Julia de Aquilar.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Turning to Noco, who had regained her breath,
de Sancerre said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say to this servant of the sun that I grant
him pardon for his foolish threats. But warn
him to take heed of how he walks. Unless he
payeth abject homage to my power, it may go
hard with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Waving his rapier &#8217;til it flashed before the eyes
of the overawed priest like a magic wand made
of silvery moonbeams, de Sancerre strode with
studied dignity toward Noco&#8217;s hut, and disappeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
from sight. The sun-priests, headed by
their subdued chief, filed solemnly toward their
blood-stained temple, and presently the moon,
drooping toward the west, gazed down upon a
city apparently abandoned by all men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>IN WHICH DE SANCERRE BREAKS HIS FAST AND SMILES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Worn</span> out with the exhausting experiences of
long hours, unprecedented, even in his varied career,
for the many contrasted emotions with
which they had assailed him, de Sancerre had
thrown himself, fully dressed, upon a bed of
plaited reeds in Noco&#8217;s hut, and, despite his inclination
to muse upon the joy and wonder of
the day&#8217;s concluding episode, had fallen into a
dreamless, restful sleep, which still wrapped him
in its benign embrace long after the sun-god had
blinked at the matutinal shouts with which the
shining orb was greeted by its worshippers at
dawn. The day was nearly ten hours of age
before the Frenchman, stretching his arms and
legs to their full length, awoke suddenly, and,
with a smile upon his lips and a gleam of happiness
in his eyes, recalled instantly the marvel
which had made his present environment, with
all its perils, a delight to his refreshed and ardent
soul. Suddenly he discovered that while
he slept his outer garments had been removed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Turning on his side he raised his head, rested it
upon his hand, and glanced toward the centre of
the room, which still bore marks of the disorder
begotten by the hasty flight of the disguised
Franciscan and his charge.</p>

<p>Squatting upon the ground beside a bench,
upon which rested de Sancerre&#8217;s nether garments,
sat old Noco, busily plying her fish-bone
needle, while she repaired the many rents in his
doublet and crooned a monotonous chant in a
harsh, guttural voice. At the further end of the
hut a crackling fire sent forth an odor which increased
the satisfaction of the Frenchman with
his surroundings. With corn-meal and fish, de
Sancerre&#8217;s hostess had prepared a repast which
the most fastidious palate at Versailles would
have found seductive. Upon a small bench at
Noco&#8217;s right hand stood a bowl of reddish crockery,
in which wild strawberries awaited the
pleasure of her guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will pardon me, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; cried de Sancerre,
gayly, &#8220;if I remark that my present plight
is somewhat embarrassing. I shall be late at
table unless my overworked wardrobe is restored
to me at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mas vale tarde que nunca!</i>&#8221; retorted the old
hag, glancing inquiringly at the fire, and then
resuming her patchwork. &#8220;You slept well,
se&ntilde;or?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;Like a log,&#8221; answered de Sancerre&mdash;&#8220;a log
saved from the sacred fire. And now, there is
no time to lose! We have before us, Do&ntilde;a
Noco, a busy day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; returned his hostess, approaching his
bedside with his rejuvenated garments upon her
withered arm. &#8220;&#8217;Tis well to wait a while. When
Cabanacte has returned, we&#8217;ll hold a council and
perfect a plan. It is not fitting that the Brother
of the Moon should show himself at once.
My people worship best the gods they do not
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again de Sancerre caught in Noco&#8217;s eyes a
mocking gleam which once before had placed
him in close sympathy with her. That this old
hag, whose mind was quick and clear, had, in
her heart of hearts, discarded many of the ancient
superstitions to which she outwardly conformed
the Frenchman more than half suspected.
But he spoke no further word to her until he
had made a hasty toilet, and, refreshed by an
application of cool water to his face and hands,
had seated himself upon a bench to rejoice his inner
man with strawberries, corn-cake, and skilfully-cooked
fish. The variety of Noco&#8217;s accomplishments
filled de Sancerre with mingled
admiration and astonishment. Speaking two
languages, expert with her needle, an admirable
cook, quick-witted, fertile in resource, the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
woman impressed the Frenchman that morning
as a being well entitled to his respect and gratitude.
But his mind dwelt no long time upon
the praiseworthy versatility of his aged hostess.
Impatient and impetuous by nature, he chafed
sorely at inaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cabanacte!&#8221; he exclaimed, after he had satisfied
his appetite, observing that Noco had disposed
of the most exacting of her many tasks.
&#8220;When think you, se&ntilde;ora, your grandson will
return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When &#8217;tis best for you, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; answered the
old woman, shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And &#8217;twas he, Do&ntilde;a Noco, who found Coyocop,
the spirit of the sun, by the shore of the
great sea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas Cabanacte who found Coyocop, whose
coming was foretold when the mountains were
but hillocks, and bore her to the sacred City of
the Sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He found her by the sea alone?&#8221; asked de
Sancerre, wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Brother of the Moon should know all
things,&#8221; muttered Noco, with satire in her eyes
and voice. Then she went on: &#8220;The white-faced
children of the moon who bore her to our land
lay sleeping on the beach, awaiting the coming of
their god to waken them. But Cabanacte knew
that she was Coyocop. And so, she came to us.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>From outside the hut de Sancerre could hear
the noises of a town astir, the tread of bare-footed
men upon the hardened earth, the cries of
children at their play, and, now and then, the
voices of women chattering of many wondrous
things. He longed to make his way at once to
Coyocop&#8217;s abode that with his eyes he might
assure himself that last night&#8217;s strange adventures
had not taken place in dreams. Even yet,
he found it hard to believe that Julia de Aquilar
was, in reality, a captive, like himself, in this
weird town. But there lay her own handwriting
on the bark! He read and reread the message
which she had sent to him, and, turning toward
Noco, asked, pensively:</p>

<p>&#8220;Coyocop, se&ntilde;ora, seemed glad to learn that I
was here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not what the chief priest may have
thought,&#8221; croaked the old crone, a gleam of malice
in her black eyes as they met de Sancerre&#8217;s
gaze, &#8220;but to me she seemed less like a goddess
than a girl. She wept for joy to read your
note.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre sprang to his feet and paced up
and down the hut restlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cabanacte!&#8221; he exclaimed, petulantly. &#8220;<i>Nom
de Dieu!</i> When will the man return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We care not much for women in this land of
ours,&#8221; muttered Noco, using her broken Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
to tease her impatient guest. &#8220;Out of clay the
Great Spirit moulded the first man, and, pleased
with what he&#8217;d made, blew into him the breath
of life. And thus he fell to sneezing, the first
man, &#8217;til from his nose there dropped a doll-shaped
thing which set to dancing upon the
ground there at his feet. And as she danced,
she grew in size, until a woman stood before his
eyes. It is not strange that man should make
us work!&#8221; A sarcastic grin rested upon the
hag&#8217;s brown face as she gazed up at de Sancerre.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Coyocop is more than woman,&#8221; cried de
Sancerre, earnestly. &#8220;<i>Caramba!</i> But you love
to torture me, se&ntilde;ora! I say to you, beware! I
know not what may lie the deepest in your
heart, but this I say to you, &#8217;twill serve you
well to do your best for me. The time is coming
when I&#8217;ll pay you tenfold for your kindness
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noco drew near to the Frenchman and stood
before him, listening for a time to the familiar
noises outside her hut. Then she asked, in a
tone which had no mischief in it:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Spanish, se&ntilde;or. Do you love them
well?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment de Sancerre, startled by so unexpected
an interrogatory, gazed down at the
old hag, speechless. His suspicious mind strove
in vain to find her motive for a question which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
seemed to him, at first, to have no bearing upon
the topics they had just discussed. But his intuitions
told him that upon the answer he should
make to her would depend her attitude toward
him from this time forth. By one word, he well
knew, he might destroy in an instant the good-will
of the one ally who could save him and Julia
de Aquilar from the dangers which menaced them.
Noco spoke Spanish, a tongue which, it seemed
probable, she had learned from her immediate
ancestors. That the Spaniards had treated the
native Americans with great cruelty, de Sancerre
had often heard. Was it possible that Noco had
inherited a hatred for a race of oppressors from
whom her forebears had fled in fear? On the
chance that this might be, the Frenchman, hesitating
only a moment, decided finally to tell the
truth to his dusky inquisitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do&ntilde;a Noco,&#8221; said de Sancerre, impressively,
placing a hand upon the old crone&#8217;s arm, &#8220;the
Spanish are my dearest foes. Often have I led
my men against them on the fields of war. I hold
for them a hatred only less intense than the love
I bear for Coyocop.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dark, beady eyes of the beldame seemed
to search de Sancerre&#8217;s very soul. Suddenly she
fell upon her knees, and, seizing his cold hand,
pressed it to her shrivelled lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am your servant, se&ntilde;or&mdash;even unto death,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
she muttered, hoarsely. Then she sprang to her
feet with marvellous agility and stood listening
intently, as if the noise outside bore some new
tale to her quick ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Cabanacte!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;And with
him comes the sister of the foolish man they
slew.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly had de Sancerre grasped the significance
of her words, when Katonah, followed by
Noco&#8217;s grandson, stole into the hut, panting as if
their journey had been a hurried one.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bienvenue</i>, Katonah!&#8221; cried de Sancerre, a
note of mingled annoyance and surprise in his
voice. &#8220;I did not think to see you here again.
You bring me word from Sieur de la Salle?&#8221;</p>

<p>Katonah&#8217;s sensitive ear caught the hollow
sound in the Frenchman&#8217;s word of welcome.
The suggestion of a sad smile played across her
weary face, as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The great captain urged me not to come.
But, monsieur, I was so lonely! With you and
Chat&eacute;muc not there, I could not stay.&#8221; A suppressed
sob checked her words. Handing to de
Sancerre a note from de la Salle, the Mohican
maiden seated herself upon a bench and gazed
mournfully at the glowing embers of Noco&#8217;s
dying fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, Cabanacte, I&#8217;m glad to see your
giant form again!&#8221; cried de Sancerre, smiling as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
he perused de la Salle&#8217;s epistle. It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Let this chance, monsieur, to serve your king atone for
your disobedience to me. Be firm, unbending, and conservative.
Well I know that you will be courageous. Await me
where you are. I return shortly, and will send for you. I
must teach the mouth of this great river to speak the name
of France. I go to ring the knell of Spain! <i>Adieu et au
revoir!</i></p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">De la Salle.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bien!</i>&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre, kissing his
hand to old Noco, smilingly. &#8220;We hold the
cards we need. &#8217;Twill be my fault if blunders
now should lose the game we play.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman had come to the side of her eccentric
guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;My captain,&#8221; went on de Sancerre, in a lower
tone, &#8220;a brother of the moon-god, like myself,
tells me in this note that he goes to seize a kingdom
from our Spanish foes. You are content,
se&ntilde;ora? You are content?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, se&ntilde;or, well content!&#8221; answered the old
hag with grim emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; exclaimed the Frenchman, beckoning
to Cabanacte to approach them, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
hold a solemn council, for the truth is this: unless
I soon have speech with Coyocop, my throbbing
heart will thump itself to death. Tell me,
Cabanacte, is there danger for yon maiden, whose
brother died the death?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>The bronze athlete had stretched himself at de
Sancerre&#8217;s feet in such a position that he could
fix his gaze upon the sombre beauty of Katonah&#8217;s
face. He showed his perfect teeth, and his black
eyes gleamed as he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger for her? No, none! Not while
Cabanacte lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre smiled gayly. Cabanacte&#8217;s answer
had delighted him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>IN WHICH DE SANCERRE HEARS NEWS OF THE<br />
GREAT SUN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Count de Sancerre&#8217;s desire to come to
an immediate decision regarding a line of action
that should lead him at once into the living
presence of Coyocop was not to be gratified.
Noco&#8217;s sensitive ear, acting as a thermometer
to register the degree of excitement prevailing
outside her cabin, had heard an ominous
murmur that had lost none of its threatening
significance because it had come from afar. She
knew at once that a crowd of gossiping sun-worshippers,
inspired by some new rumor, had
gathered in the great square near the temple of
the sun. Hurrying to her grandson&#8217;s side, she
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go forth at once, Cabanacte, and mingle
with the throng outside. There&#8217;s news abroad
which makes the city talk. Return to us when
you have learned the meaning of the uproar in
the square.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dark-hued colossus reluctantly arose and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
stood, for a moment, listening to the increasing
disturbance among his easily-excited neighbors.
Hurrying feet, making toward the temple of the
sun and the King&#8217;s cabin, echoed from the street
just outside the hut. The pattering footsteps of
chattering women and children mingled with the
louder tread of stalwart men, aroused from their
siesta by an epidemic of distrust. Cabanacte,
dismayed at the grim possibilities suggested by
this unwonted demonstration upon the part of a
people little given to activity at noonday, bent
down to Noco before obeying her behest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Secrete the maiden where no prying eye can
see her,&#8221; he murmured, hoarsely, still gazing at
Katonah. &#8220;I&#8217;ll join the rabble and return at
once. I dread the cruel fervor of our priests.
But still they cannot know that it was her brother
whom they killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop not to make conjecture, Cabanacte,&#8221;
scolded the old crone, pushing her grandson
toward the hut&#8217;s ignoble exit. &#8220;I say to you,
&#8217;tis not Katonah who has made the city talk.
&#8217;Tis some calamity&mdash;I know not what.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without more ado, the tall sun-worshipper
crawled from the twilight of the hut into the
burning sunshine of the agitated street, and,
drawing himself erect, joined the gossiping
throng which poured noisily toward the great
square. To Cabanacte&#8217;s great surprise and relief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
his appearance in the open caused no added
excitement among the bronze-faced, eager-eyed
men and women who hurried by his side toward
the centre of the town. It became evident to
him at once that the news which awaited him
beyond had nothing to do with the strangers
whom he had left in the hut behind him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile de Sancerre, vexed at the delay to
which a mercurial people had forced him to submit,
gazed despondently now at Noco and now
at Katonah. French expletives, colored by a
Spanish oath at times, escaped from his erstwhile
smiling mouth. Noco had stationed herself
at the entrance to the cabin, endeavoring to
catch the echo of some enlightening rumor as it
flew back from the crowded square. Katonah,
watching the Frenchman with eyes which seemed
to implore his forgiveness, had withdrawn to a
remote corner of the room and seated herself
wearily upon a wooden bench. If she had heard
a menace to herself in the uproar in the town, she
gave no outward indication of the dread that her
heart might feel. With the proud shyness of a
sensitive girl, and the external stoicism of an Indian,
she withdrew, as far as was possible, from the
presence of her companions and made no further
sign. Had Zenobe Membr&eacute; known that at this
ominous juncture Katonah had murmured no
prayer, no invocation to the saints, the sanguine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
Franciscan would have marvelled, perhaps wept,
at the mighty gulf which stretched between the
martyred Chat&eacute;muc, secure in Paradise, and a
melancholy maiden who had known the faith
and lost it.</p>

<p>The chagrined Frenchman, fully realizing his
own impotence at this mysterious crisis, presently
arose and began to pace the room with impatient
steps. He felt like a man to whom some unexpected
and glowing promise had been given by
destiny, to be withdrawn almost at the moment of
its presentation. During the long, weary hour
which followed Cabanacte&#8217;s departure from the
hut, de Sancerre&#8217;s mind vibrated between hope
and despair. Had he made the amazing discovery
of Julia de Aquilar&#8217;s presence in the City of
the Sun only that it might mock him for his lack
of power? Could it be that fate had lured him
in malice within sound of her sweet voice to
hurl him into the lonely silence of the wilderness
at last? And to himself he swore an oath that
he would never leave the City of the Sun alive
unless the Spanish maiden fled with him to the
wilds. Death in the effort to save her from
years of hopeless captivity was preferable, a
thousand times, to life and freedom and a vain
regret. How well he loved this woman de Sancerre
had never known before. For the first
time this <i>mondain</i>, who had fondly imagined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
that life had nothing new to give him, realized
the might and majesty of a great passion, and
his soul grew sick with the fear that its ecstasy
might change to misery at last.</p>

<p>But while de Sancerre&#8217;s mind dwelt fondly
upon the joy of an all-absorbing love, it endeavored,
at the same time, to make an inventory
of the actual and the possible dangers which
he would be compelled to confront before he
could indulge the hope that the love he welcomed
would ever fulfil the promise which it
held within itself.</p>

<p>Weeks must pass before de la Salle could return
from his voyage to the gulf. Even then
the explorer had at his command no force with
which to overcome these martial and stalwart
sun-worshippers. De Sancerre&#8217;s only hope lay
in diplomacy and craft. It was essential to the
success of his scheme, whose general outlines
were already forming in his mind, that the superstitious
tendencies of the people surrounding
him be used as a tool for forging his escape.
But their fanaticism was a double-edged instrument
which must be handled with the nicest
care or it would turn within his hands and destroy
him at a blow.</p>

<p>Coyocop? How far could he trust her quickness
and discretion? That she possessed both of
these qualities he was inclined to believe. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
of her greatest charms in the blithesome days at
Versailles had consisted in her ready responsiveness
to his changing moods, in the keenness of a
mind which shone to advantage even in that
centre of the great world&#8217;s sharpest wit. As
for her discretion, had it not been proved by
the fact that she had maintained for many
months her alien authority over these fickle,
jealous, sharp-eyed people? Furthermore&mdash;and
de Sancerre lingered over the mystery with much
concern&mdash;she had, during that same period, managed
to conceal from the keen-witted and revengeful
Noco the fact that her origin was
Spanish, not divine. How well the girl must
have played a most exacting part to deceive
the eccentric old hag, de Sancerre fully realized.
That in Julia de Aquilar he would find an ally
well-fitted to play the r&ocirc;le which he had in
mind for her, her skill in blinding Noco gave
good proof. But, at the best, de Sancerre&#8217;s
growing project must win the full fruition of
success much more by chance than by design.
Even before he took initial steps, he must learn
what new excitement had aroused the lazy town
at noon.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Peste!</i>&#8221; he exclaimed, fretfully. &#8220;It was
no victory to outrun Cabanacte. His heavy
limbs are slower than a Prussian&#8217;s wits.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that very instant the hole beside which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Noco lurked was darkened by her grandson&#8217;s
stooping form. Drawing himself erect, after
he had pulled his long limbs into the hut,
Cabanacte glanced searchingly around the room
until his black eyes lighted upon the self-absorbed
Katonah. Then, followed by Noco, he
strode toward de Sancerre.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no danger to the girl,&#8221; muttered the
giant, as he seated himself upon a bench, which
groaned in protest beneath his weight. &#8220;But I
bring to you bad news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, you look it!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre
to himself, scanning the troubled countenance of
the dusky youth.</p>

<p>Turning to Noco, Cabanacte poured forth rapidly
in his native tongue the sombre story which
he had heard abroad, and then stood erect, gazing
at Katonah.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Great Sun lies dying!&#8221; exclaimed the
old woman, excitedly, turning from her grandson
to her guest. &#8220;In perfect health at sunrise,
he fell near noonday, and none can make him
speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre had sprung to his feet and was
glancing alternately down at Noco and up at
Cabanacte. The menacing significance of the
misfortune which had fallen upon the King appeared
to him at once. Had evil come to the
Great Sun in some way not readily explainable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
the crafty sun-priests would lay his sickness to
the blighting influence of the stranger&#8217;s magic,
the fatal witchery brought with him from the
moon.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dying, do you say? There is no hope?&#8221;
gasped the Frenchman, looking into Noco&#8217;s eyes
for a ray of encouragement.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dying as his mother died,&#8221; muttered the
old crone, musingly, seemingly forgetful of de
Sancerre&#8217;s presence. &#8220;But, even then, he had
long years to live. And yesterday he looked no
older than my Cabanacte there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dying, do you say?&#8221; repeated the Frenchman,
mechanically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, dying, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; hissed the beldame, spitefully.
&#8220;And now the temple priests prepare the
cords with which they&#8217;ll choke his servants and
his wives to death. No Great Sun goes alone
into the land beyond! What sights my eyes
have seen! King follows king into the spirit-world,
and with them go the best and noblest
of our weeping race. Aye, se&ntilde;or, the Great
Sun&#8217;s dying and the city mourns. When he
has passed, his household follows him. The
sight you saw but yesternight was child&#8217;s-play
for the priests. &#8217;Tis when a Great Sun dies they
have man&#8217;s sport with death.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mocking, angry tones in Noco&#8217;s guttural
voice made the broken Spanish in which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
spoke impress the Frenchman&#8217;s ears as a most
repellent tongue. De Sancerre was striving feverishly
to grasp the full significance of her grim
words, to weigh in all its bearings the new exigency
which had increased a hundredfold the
peril in which he stood. But the thought beset
him, with tyrannical persistence, that he had no
time to lose. Should the Great Sun die at once,
de Sancerre would be powerless against any revenge
which the sun-priests might, in their crafty
cruelty, seek to take. How far the homage
which they paid to Coyocop could be trusted to
save him in the crisis which would follow the
King&#8217;s death he could not determine, but he had
begun to fear that not only the priests but the
people at large would hold him responsible for
the sudden and mysterious blow which had fallen
upon the throne. With little time at his disposal
in which to examine the crisis from many points
of view, de Sancerre came quickly to the conclusion
that his doom was sealed unless he acted
with boldness, decision, and rapidity. Satisfied
of the loyalty of Noco and Cabanacte, although
he marvelled somewhat at their good-will, he
drew himself up to his full height, and, putting
up his hand to command silence, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go forth at once, Cabanacte, and tell the
people of this afflicted town that it was the insult
cast upon me by the temple priests which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
brought down the wrath of Heaven upon the
Great Sun&#8217;s head. Tell this to the rabble. Then
go to the chief priest and say to him that he,
too, shall fall with suddenness before his fire unless
he heeds the words that I shall speak. Bid
him be silent &#8217;til I come to him, and to keep
his priests at prayer. <i>Nom de Dieu</i>, my Cabanacte,
have you lost your ears? Stop staring at
me and go forth at once, or, with the ease with
which my legs outran you, I&#8217;ll strike you dead
with this!&#8221;</p>

<p>Waving his rapier threateningly at the giant&#8217;s
panting breast, de Sancerre drove the startled
athlete through the entrance to the street, and
then turned back to seize the trembling Noco by
the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a message which you must take to
Coyocop! If you should fail to gain her ear,
the City of the Sun is doomed. Say this to her,
that when I send a priest to summon her she
must be quick to join me at the Great Sun&#8217;s
lodge. Repeat my words, se&ntilde;ora.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shaking the old crone roughly by the arm, de
Sancerre bent down to catch her gasping voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bien!</i>&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you&#8217;ve conned your lesson
well! Go, now, se&ntilde;ora, and make no mistake!
If you would save your dying king, see Coyocop
and tell her what I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another instant the panting Noco, grumbling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
but overawed, had left the hut upon a mission
for which she had no hungry heart.</p>

<p>De Sancerre drew back from the entrance, and
dropped limply upon a bench. He had put into
operation a hastily-formed plan with an impetuosity
which, in its rebound, left him faint and
dazed. Suddenly a warm pressure upon his cold
hands aroused him from his momentary submission
to this enervating reaction. Looking down,
he saw that Katonah was gazing up at him with
sympathetic apprehension.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have placed you in great danger by my return!&#8221;
she exclaimed. &#8220;I am going now. I
will not come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had arisen and was about to leave the hut.
Seizing her hand, de Sancerre drew her to his
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, <i>ma petite</i>! You are not at fault! Don&#8217;t
leave me&mdash;but do not speak! I must think&mdash;I
must think! But my mind&#8217;s in a whirl. <i>Courage</i>,
Katonah! There, do not tremble so! <i>Ma foi</i>,
little one, &#8217;tis a hard nut we have to crack!
There, do not move! Let me take your hand.
<i>Bien!</i> Now, let me think!&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence, intense, unbroken, reigned within the
hut; while, outside, the hot sun beat down upon
a city in which rumor itself had become voiceless
in growing dread of a fatal word.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>IN WHICH COHEYOGO EXHIBITS HIS CRAFTINESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the Great Sun, by virtue of his divine
origin, was technically the high-priest of the nation,
it had come about, at the time of Count
Louis de Sancerre&#8217;s sojourn among the sun-worshippers,
that the chief of the holy men, upon
whom devolved the duty of keeping alive the
sacred fire, had, by the strength of his bigoted
personality, usurped all religious authority and
had made the temple independent of, and more
potent than, the royal cabin. While the chief
priest had never openly defied the Great Sun, he
had, nevertheless, gradually become the most influential
personage in the nation.</p>

<p>It was the advent of Coyocop which had given
to Coheyogo, the chief priest, an opportunity for
making himself, with no visible break between
the church and state, practically omnipotent in
the City of the Sun.</p>

<p>Just how thoroughly Coheyogo believed that
Julia de Aquilar was the very incarnation of the
sun-spirit which, tradition had assured his people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
would come to them from the shore of a distant
sea, it is impossible to say. It is a fact,
however, that from the moment of her arrival
among the sun-worshippers the chief priest had
openly accepted the maiden as a supernatural
guest from whom emanated an authority which
he and his fellow-priests were in duty bound to
obey. For the furtherance of his own ends and
the increase of his own power, the crafty Coheyogo
could have taken no better course.</p>

<p>It had come about that Noco as interpreter&mdash;the
connecting link between the spirit of the sun
and the chief priest of the temple&mdash;had found
herself in a position of great influence. The old
hag, a compound of superstition, spitefulness,
and saturnine humor done up in a crumpled
brown package, had derived malicious satisfaction
from playing Coheyogo&#8217;s game with a skill
and an audacity which had saved her from the
many perils which had menaced her in the pursuit
of this eccentric pastime.</p>

<p>Coheyogo would visit Coyocop with Noco and
lay before the sun-spirit some problem dealing
with the attitude of the temple toward a question
at that moment interesting the sun-worshippers.
The quick-witted and fearless interpreter would
answer the chief priest with advice originating
in her own fertile brain, and, in this way, would
protect Coyocop from cares of state, while she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
made a willing tool of Coheyogo and satisfied
her own love of mischief. Within well-defined
limitations, old Noco, at the moment of which
we write, held under her control more actual
power than either the Great Sun or the chief
priest. As the tongue of Coyocop, the court of
last resort in a priest-ridden state, the old crone,
with little fear of detection, could put into the
mouth of the sun-spirit whatever words she chose.
Fortunately for Coyocop and the sun-worshippers,
the aged linguist was, at heart, progressive rather
than reactionary. She had cherished for years a
detestation for the bloody sacrifices of the temple,
which heterodoxy, had Coheyogo suspected it,
would have long ago brought her life to a sudden
end. As it was, the old interpreter had
made use of Coyocop to mitigate, as far as possible,
the horrors which a cruel cult, administered by
heartless priests, had inflicted upon a brave, kindly,
but too plastic race.</p>

<p>It was now a full hour past high noon, and
Coheyogo stood, surrounded by the temple
priests, confronting Cabanacte by the sacred fire.
The interior of the sun-temple was not less repulsive
to an unbiased eye than the skull-crowned
palisades outside. Divided into two rooms of
unequal size, the interior of the blood-stained
fane served the double purpose of a gigantic
oven to keep the veins of the living at fever-heat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
and of a tomb in which the bones of the noble dead
might crumble into dust. In the larger of the
two rooms, in which the chief priest was now
holding a council of the elders, stood an altar
seven feet long by two in width and rising to a
height of four feet above the floor. Upon this
altar rested a long, hand-painted basket in which
reposed the remains of the reigning Great Sun&#8217;s
immediate predecessor.</p>

<p>The heat of the room was intense, for no windows
broke the monotony of the temple&#8217;s walls;
mud-baked partitions, nine inches in thickness.
Rows of plaited mats covered the arched ceiling of
the interior. At the end of the room furthest
from the sacred fire, folding doors, closed at this
moment, opened into the private apartments of
the chief priest. Running from these doors,
along both sides of the smoke-blackened hall,
wooden shelves supported the grewsome relics of
horrid ceremonials. Long lines of baskets, daubed
with red and yellow paint, contained the revered
dust of Great Suns gone into the land of spirits
accompanied by the loyal souls of their strangled
wives and retainers. Scattered between these
tawdry urns, the shelves bore crudely-wrought
clay figures of men, women, serpents, owls,
and eagles; and here and there an offering
of fruit, meat, or fish stood ready to satisfy
the craving of any uneasy ghost coming back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
dissatisfied with the cuisine of the spirit-world.</p>

<p>Grouped around the sacred fire, in which logs
of oak and walnut preserved a flame which the
sun-god had vouchsafed to man in a remote day
of grace, the temple priests, whose dark faces
bore evidence of their internal agitation, stood
listening and watching as Cabanacte and Coheyogo
faced each other at this crisis and discussed,
in subdued tones, a question of immediate significance.
As the chosen discoverer of Coyocop,
the instrument employed by the great spirit for
the fulfilment of an ancient prophecy, Cabanacte
occupied an influential position in the eyes of
the temple brotherhood. The inspiration from
on high, which had turned the giant&#8217;s feet toward
a haunted shingle upon which the spirit of the
sun lay asleep, might at any moment stir his
tongue with words of divine origin. Since the
night upon which Cabanacte had brought Coyocop
to the City of the Sun, he had always been
listened to with rapt attention by the jealous
guardians of the sacred fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;He threatens me, you say?&#8221; muttered Coheyogo
angrily, gazing up at Cabanacte with flashing eyes.
&#8220;And you have told the people that
the Great Sun dies because I do not worship
this white-faced conjurer who says the moon is
his? Beware, oh Cabanacte, what you do! I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
dare the magic of his silver wand and prove to
him the sun-god is omnipotent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drawing himself up to his full height, until he
towered a full half-foot above the stately sun-priest,
Cabanacte exclaimed, in a low, insistent
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you forgotten Coyocop? Did she not
last night&mdash;old Noco tells the tale&mdash;command
you to do honor to this white face from the moon?
&#8217;Tis you, Coheyogo, who should now take heed.
&#8217;Tis not moon-magic which you would defy.
&#8217;Tis Coyocop herself, the spirit of the sun, our
god.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief priest remained silent for a time,
gazing thoughtfully at the sacred fire, which
seemed to roar and flash and snap and dance
before his restless black eyes as if it threatened
him with tortures for harboring a sacrilegious
thought. Had not the spirit of the sun itself,
through Coyocop&#8217;s inspired tongue, commanded
him to treat the nation&#8217;s white-faced guest with
all respect? The great power which Coheyogo
had wielded for a year seemed to be slipping from
his grasp. Its foundation-stone had been the
word of Coyocop. Should he not heed her late
behest he&#8217;d pull the very underpinning from
beneath his tower of strength. Furthermore, the
Great Sun, an easy-going monarch, subservient to
the chief priest&#8217;s stronger will, lay at death&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
door. His successor to the throne, his sister&#8217;s
son, Manatte, was a headstrong, stubborn youth,
upon whom the influence of Coheyogo was but
slight. Should the chief priest lose at one stroke
the countenance of Coyocop and the good-will
of the Great Sun, the supremacy of the temple
would be destroyed upon the instant, and Coheyogo
would find himself hurled from a pinnacle
of power to a grovelling attitude among a people
chafing under the cruel tyranny of a bloodthirsty
priesthood. Turning fretfully from the threatening
blaze to glance up again at the steady eyes
of Cabanacte, the chief priest said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The words of Coyocop come straight from
God.&#8221; Facing then the expectant priests, he
cried sternly: &#8220;Go forth, my brothers, and bid
the people to disperse at once. Tell them to go
to their homes and offer prayers that the Great
Sun may be spared to us. Then come to me
here, for I have other work for you to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Left alone in the stilling room with Cabanacte,
the chief priest went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Direct the moon-man and old Noco to attend
me here. If yonder white face has no evil wish,
it may be that his magic may save our king from
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cabanacte smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not, Coheyogo,&#8221; he remarked, as he
turned toward the exit to the temple, &#8220;that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
envoy from the moon will heed your curt command.
But this I do believe, that, if besought,
he&#8217;d use his greatest power to save our Sun alive.
I will return to you at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words the dusky giant strode past
the hideous, grinning idols of baked clay, and
the plaited coffins of the royal dead, and made
his way to the great square from which the
white-robed priests were driving an awe-struck,
moaning people to their homes.</p>

<p>Coheyogo, glancing furtively around the deserted
hall in which the spectres of the dead
seemed ready to chase the flickering shadows
cast by the miraculous fire, bent down and threw
a huge log into the mocking flame, as if to quiet
for a moment its spiteful, chiding voice. Suddenly
behind him he heard the stealthy footfall of
a white-robed underling. Turning quickly from
the fire, Coheyogo&#8217;s piercing eyes rested upon a
priest whom he had recently despatched to the
Great Sun&#8217;s cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What news?&#8221; cried the chief priest, eagerly.
&#8220;He still lives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Magani! Listen, master! He lives, and,
tossing on his bed, mutters strange words beneath
his breath. &#8217;Tis a devil that is in him, for he
talks of things we cannot see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And his physician?&#8221; asked Coheyogo, impatiently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>&#8220;He has done his best, but his eyes are wild
and he shakes his head in impotence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll shake it in the noose should the Great
Sun die,&#8221; muttered the chief priest, with cruel
emphasis. &#8220;What boots his boasted skill if he
fails us when we need him most? But, hark!
Our brothers have returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Filing into the temple like a procession of
white ghosts with charred faces, the priests of
the sun grouped themselves in a circle behind
their chief, and stood awaiting in silence the outcome
of a crisis which might, at its worst, satisfy
their ever-present craving for human sacrifices to
offer to their god, the innocent and genial orb
of day. That the cruel and crafty Coheyogo
dreaded the news of the Great Sun&#8217;s death more
keenly than they, in their love for an inhuman
custom, desired it, they had no means of knowing.
But they were to learn presently that there
was a new force at work in their city with which
they had never before been called upon to deal.
As they stood there silent, eager-eyed, remorseless,
longing for a continuance of the thrilling sport
for which the death of Chat&eacute;muc had but whetted
their appetites, the sound of light, dainty footsteps
approaching the entrance to the temple
reached their quick ears. Turning toward the
doorway at the further end of the hall, Coheyogo
and his motionless and noiseless brood gazed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
upon an approaching figure which, in spite of its
lack of size, was most impressive at that fateful
moment. De Sancerre had donned a flowing
garment of white mulberry bark, which hid his
gay velvets from view and fell in graceful lines
from his neck to his feet. His head was bare,
and his hair, a picturesque mixture of black and
gray, emphasized the pleasing contour of his pale,
clean-cut face.</p>

<p>With drawn rapier, the symbol of his dreaded
moon-magic, the French aristocrat, his eyes fixed
upon the chief priest, strode solemnly toward
the sacred fire, followed at a distance by
Noco and her long-limbed grandson. As he
came to a halt in front of Coheyogo, de Sancerre
raised the hilt of his sword to his chin and made
a graceful, sweeping salute with the weapon.
Turning to Noco, who had now reached his side,
he said to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say to the chief priest that I come to him in
amity or in defiance, as he may choose. Tell
him that the Brother of the Moon makes no idle
boasts, but that &#8217;tis safer for the City of the Sun
to win his friendship than to arouse his wrath.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_176.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;COOL, MOTIONLESS, WITH UNFLINCHING EYES, THE FRENCHMAN STOOD<br />
WATCHING THE CHIEF PRIEST&#8221;</p>

<p>Coheyogo, with a face which none could read,
listened attentively to the old crone&#8217;s defiant
words. His black eyes held the Frenchman&#8217;s
gaze to his. There was something in the latter&#8217;s
glance that exercised upon the sun-worshipper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
a potent fascination, an influence more effective
than the impression made upon him by Noco&#8217;s
speech. The lower type of man succumbed, in
spite of his physical superiority, to the will-power
of a higher and more complicated intellect than
his own. Even had Coheyogo considered it expedient
at that moment to wreak summary vengeance
upon his white-faced, smiling challenger,
it is to be doubted that his tongue could have
uttered the words which would have sent de
Sancerre to his doom. Cool, motionless, with unflinching
eyes and a mouth which wore the outlines
of a derisive smile, the undersized Frenchman
stood watching the chief priest, outwardly
as self-confident as if he had possessed, in reality,
the destructive power of which he boasted.
Presently Coheyogo turned to Noco, whose
wrinkled countenance was twitching with excitement
in the fitful glow of the sacred fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chief Priest of the Sun has no quarrel
with the Brother of the Moon,&#8221; said the old hag,
addressing de Sancerre a moment later. &#8220;But
he says to him that the Great Sun, in health and
strength at sunrise, now lies tossing in peril of
his life. Is it true, he asks, that you have
threatened to bring down the same strange
sickness upon the temple priests?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if they do the bidding of Coyocop, the
spirit of the sun,&#8221; answered de Sancerre, curtly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
closely scanning Coheyogo&#8217;s face as Noco repeated
his words. Then he turned to the interpreter
and went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the chief priest understand that the spirit
of the sun and the spirit of the moon go hand in
hand, to the greater glory of the God of gods.
Say to him that together Coyocop and I can
make a nation great or destroy it at a word.
Disobedience to us is impiety to God. If he,
Coheyogo, would know this truth, he must be
docile, patient, and abide my time. If in his
mind the shadow of a doubt remains that what I
say is true, let him recall the legends of his race,
the promises and prophecies which your fathers
told their sons.&#8221;</p>

<p>There reigned an ominous silence in the stifling,
ill-smelling room for a time, broken only
by the malicious crackling of the sacred fire or
the impatient grunt of some overwrought priest.
Coheyogo, fearing to lose his power by accepting
the proffered alliance, but too superstitious to
defy the unseen rulers of the universe by rejecting it,
stood, grim and self-absorbed, scanning a
distressing problem from many points of view.
He dared not offend Coyocop, but he resented
de Sancerre&#8217;s claim to a share in the supernatural
authority which the sun-worshippers had attributed
to her. After long reflection, the chief
priest looked down at the grinning Noco and said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;Say to the Brother of the Moon that if he
has sufficient power to bring down destruction
upon this City of the Sun, or even to cast an evil
spell upon our king, he is wise enough to cure
the latter of the sickness which has laid him low.
If he will lead the Great Sun back to us from
the very gates of death, he will find within this
temple none but servants glad to pay him homage
and obey his words. But, if he fails to raise
our king, &#8217;twill prove to us he either boasts too
much or bears us no good-will.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre&#8217;s lips turned a shade lighter, but
the mocking smile did not desert them, as Noco
translated Coheyogo&#8217;s ultimatum into her clumsy
Spanish. But even in that moment of supreme
dismay, when his life, so he reflected, had been
staked against loaded dice, the Frenchman could
not refrain from casting a glance of admiration
at the crafty priest who had played his game so
well. If de Sancerre should undertake the restoration
of the Great Sun&#8217;s health and should
fail to save his life, even Coyocop would be
powerless to protect him from the fate which
had befallen Chat&eacute;muc. He had planned to visit
the sick-bed of the King, and to send for Julia
de Aquilar to meet him there, should he find
that the Great Sun lay afflicted by no contagious
disease. But de Sancerre had not foreseen that
his boastfulness&mdash;which had served him well at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
times&mdash;would place him in his present plight,
making his very life dependent upon his skill as
a physician. He dared not hesitate, however, to
accept the gauntlet thrown down by the keen-witted
schemer, whose black eyes were now fixed
upon him with a sardonic, defiant gleam.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will give me great joy to restore my
friend, the ruler of this land, to health,&#8221; said
de Sancerre calmly to Noco, his gaze still meeting
Coheyogo&#8217;s unwaveringly. &#8220;Will you request
the chief priest to accompany me to the
royal bedside?&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words, the Frenchman turned his
back upon the sacred fire and its jealous guardian,
and strode haughtily toward the temple&#8217;s exit.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Nom de Dieu</i>,&#8221; he muttered to himself,
&#8220;I know more about the slaying of my fellow-men
than how to save them from the jaws of
death! I would I could recall the odds and ends
of medicine I&#8217;ve gathered in my time! But,
even then, I fear my skill would not suffice. The
Great Sun, if I mistake not, has no more to gain
from me than I from him. St. Maturin, be kind
to us!&#8221;</p>

<small>IN WHICH A WHITE ROBE FAILS TO PROTECT<br />
A BLACK HEART</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Seated</span> upon a low couch of plaited reeds,
Julia de Aquilar, her white, slender hands folded
upon her lap, and her dark, eloquent eyes turned
upward as if they rested upon the Virgin Mother&#8217;s
face, listened for the footsteps of a worldling
and a sceptic, whose irreverent tongue had
often in her hearing made sport of love itself.
Her year in captivity as a celestial guide and
counsellor to a half-savage race had softened,
while preserving, the splendid coloring of her
flawless complexion. Paler than of old, her face
had lost none of its marvellous symmetry, and
the warm hue of her curving lips bore witness
to the triumph which youth, in its abounding
elasticity, had won over the allied forces of loneliness
and despair. The shadows beneath her
expectant eyes had but added to their glowing
splendor. Long days and nights of revery and
introspection had changed the dominant expression
of her face, somewhat too haughty aforetime,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
and a gentle radiance seemed to emanate
from a countenance which had gained an added
fascination from the spiritualizing touches of a
sorrow too deep for tears.</p>

<p>The room in which Do&ntilde;a Julia sat at this moment,
watching and praying for a rescuer whose
advent had been made possible only through a
miracle vouchsafed by Mary and the saints, testified
to the homage which was paid by the sun-worshippers
to the spirit, Coyocop. Bunches
of early spring flowers, borne to her cabin by
devotees who had never looked upon her face,
were scattered in profusion upon the earthen
floor and along the wooden shelves fitted into
the gray walls. Offerings of dried fruits, and
more substantial edibles, indicated the anxiety
of an afflicted people to propitiate the unseen
powers in this day of peril to their prostrate
chief. Fabrics woven with commendable skill
in various colors, and bits of pottery showing
artistic possibilities in the makers thereof, added
to the polychromatic ensemble of Coyocop&#8217;s sacred
retreat. At that very instant Do&ntilde;a Julia
could hear the murmurs of a group of devout
sun-worshippers, who had come from the budding
forest to pile before her door great heaps
of magnolia blossoms to bear witness to their
reverence for the beneficent spirit of the sun, and
to their hope that she would save them from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
their threatening doom. The skull-bedecked
temple of the sun stood for all that was most
savage in a cult demanding human blood. The
hut of Coyocop, wellnigh hidden from the noonday
by sacrificial flowers, gave forth a fragrant
incense which arose from an altar built of loving
hearts.</p>

<p>It was the assurance, which had come to her
in many ways, that she possessed the reverential
affection of thousands of men and women upon
whom she had never gazed that had lightened
Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s captivity, and had vouchsafed to
her lonely soul a source of inspiration without
which her faith in heaven might have lost its
strength. Horrified to find herself worshipped
as a goddess, but fearful of the fate which might
befall her should she make denial of her divinity,
she had passed long months in silent misery,
theoretically omnipotent, but practically a helpless
captive; used, for their own selfish purposes,
by a few schemers, and adored at a distance by
priest-ridden thousands who cherished, in their
heart of hearts, the hope that Coyocop would
mitigate the cruel cult which stained their temple
red.</p>

<p>The Great Sun came in state to visit her at
times, and, more often, Manatte, his nephew and
heir-apparent, presuming upon his royal prerogatives,
would enter her cabin to feast his black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
eyes upon the beauty of a countenance which he
was bound to look upon as sacred from the touch
of human lips. The tall, dusky youth, whose
handsome, wilful face Do&ntilde;a Julia had grown to
loathe, had never dared to rebel against the restraints
which Coyocop&#8217;s divine origin forced
upon him, but his restless eyes told the girl what
was in his protesting heart, and she would watch
his reluctant steps, as he stole from her hut, with
mingled relief and dread. Well she knew that
fear of the Brother of the Sun and of the chief
priest alone prevented Manatte from defying the
Great Spirit and making her his own.</p>

<p>The afternoon was growing old, and Do&ntilde;a Julia,
with a bunch of white flowers upon her bosom,
relieving the black monotony of her sombre garb,
still awaited in loneliness the coming of Louis
de Sancerre, whose presence in that remote corner
of the globe only the saints in heaven could
explain. That Coheyogo and Noco, who came
to her daily to play a solemn farce in which she
had long ago lost all interest, had not made their
accustomed advent to her cabin filled her with
increasing alarm. The uproar in the city at
noonday, the mournful outcries of an agitated
people, had aroused in Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s soul a dread
foreboding which the subsequent silence which
had fallen upon the hysterical town had done
nothing to relieve.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>Presently the overwrought girl, from whose
lips the cup of hope seemed to have been
snatched just as she was about to drink deep of
its grateful draught, fell upon her knees beside
her bed and breathed a fervent prayer to the
Mother of Christ for strength in this hour of
doubt and discouragement. Soothed by her devotions,
she arose and, standing erect, listened
for the sound of a footstep which should precede
an answer to her supplication; but an ominous
silence reigned outside her hut. Readjusting the
flowers upon her breast, and smoothing her rebellious,
raven hair with a trembling hand, Do&ntilde;a
Julia, cold with a sense of loneliness which had
fallen upon her heart, moved hesitatingly toward
the hole which served as a clumsy entrance to
the room. Bending down, her hungry eyes
eagerly scanned the deserted square, upon which
the sun was shining as if in search of its secreted
worshippers. To the overpowering sweetness of
the spring blossoms, lying in heaps outside the
doorway, she gave no heed, as she sought in
vain for signs of life in a city upon which the
blight of a great fear had recently descended.
Suddenly, as Do&ntilde;a Julia gazed in consternation
at this lonely centre of a populous town, a tall
form issued from the cabin of the Great Sun.
Drawing himself up to his full height, the man,
glancing in all directions, as if to assure himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
that he was unobserved, made straight toward
the hole in the sun-baked wall through which
the girl was peering. The white feathers in his
hair bore witness to his royal rank, and as he
came into the full glare of the sunlight just beyond
her cabin Do&ntilde;a Julia saw that her approaching
visitor was Manatte. To rush forth
into the square and arouse the city by her cries
was her first impulse, but before she could give
way to it the youth had cut off her escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coyocop!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he stood erect,
after he had crawled through the entrance, driving
her back in affright toward the centre of the
flower-bedecked room. &#8220;Coyocop!&#8221;</p>

<p>There were in his voice passion, triumph, desperation;
an appeal to the woman and a defiance
to the gods. The Great Sun lay dying.
Even the chief priest would hesitate to offend
him&mdash;Manatte, who would soon be king!</p>

<p>&#8220;Coyocop!&#8221; he repeated more gently, holding
forth to her a hand, like a beggar asking alms,
while his eyes rested upon the white flowers
which rose and fell upon her throbbing bosom.</p>

<p>But, though her body trembled, there was no
flinching in Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s glance. Hopeless, as
she was, for she realized that sacrilege such as
this could spring only from an opportunity in
which Manatte could find no peril, her eyes
gazed into his with a proud scorn which left no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
need for words. With head thrown back, she
strove to conquer the brute nature of the youth
by the mere force of her strong will and the
purity of her virgin soul. But she knew full
well that the silent prayers which she offered up
to God would reach His throne too late.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood thus confronting
one another; Purity attired in black, and License
enrobed in spotless white. Never afterward
could Julia de Aquilar sense the sweet, haunting
odor of magnolia blossoms without a sinking of
the heart which made her breath protest. No
sound broke the intense stillness save the twittering
of birds which wooed the flowers outside the
hut and the stifled words which Manatte strove
to speak. Suddenly he sprang toward her and
seized her wrists, while his bronze face burned
her cold, white cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coyocop,&#8221; he muttered, in a tongue which
she could not understand, &#8220;you shall be mine,
&#8217;though every star the midnight sky reveals
should send a god to save you from my love!&#8221;</p>

<p>A maiden&#8217;s despairing cry startled the silent
town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother of God, have mercy! Help! O
Christ, save me!&#8221;</p>

<p>A light, nervous footfall echoed from the
square, and the entrance to the hut was darkened
for an instant. Rapier in hand, de Sancerre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
sprang into the centre of the room. As Manatte,
with an oath upon his swollen lips, turned upon
the intruder, the Frenchman drove his sword
straight through a snow-white robe into a black
heart. Without a groan, the evil scion of a
royal race fell dead upon the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, I came in time!&#8221; exclaimed de
Sancerre, as he withdrew his rapier from Manatte&#8217;s
breast and turned toward Do&ntilde;a Julia,
who, faint and breathless, leaned against the wall
facing him. &#8220;Do&ntilde;a Julia de Aquilar,&#8221; he cried,
tossing his dripping sword to the ground and
crossing the room at a stride, &#8220;I kiss your hand.&#8221;
Falling upon one knee the courtier pressed his
lips to the cold, trembling fingers in his grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother of Mary, I thank thee for thy care,&#8221;
murmured Do&ntilde;a Julia raising her eyes to heaven
from the smiling, upturned face of de Sancerre.</p>

<p>It was upon a tableau which might have suggested,
to other eyes, a worldling praying to a
saint for pardon for the murder of a giant that
Coheyogo, followed by Noco and Cabanacte,
gazed as he entered the hut and attempted to
read the story of the grim picture by which he
was confronted. De Sancerre, who had doffed
his white robes in the Great Sun&#8217;s cabin, still
knelt at the feet of the pale and agitated girl.
Near the centre of the room lay the bleeding,
motionless body of the sacrilegious sun-worshipper.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
Thrown from a shelf by the recent tumult
in the room, a great bunch of magnolia blossoms
lay scattered close to Manatte&#8217;s head, a floral
halo of which death itself still left him most
unworthy.</p>

<p>Springing to his feet and pointing toward the
youth he had slain, de Sancerre said, calmly, to
Noco:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the chief priest this, that yonder scoundrel
insulted the spirit of the sun. For this he
died. It was this sword,&#8221; he went on, picking
up his rapier and wiping the blood from the
blade with a handful of flowers, &#8220;which saved
Coyocop from his polluting kiss. I know not
who he is, but were he ten thousand times a son
of suns he well deserved his death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coheyogo stood gazing down at the set face
of Manatte as Noco repeated to him the Frenchman&#8217;s
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand at the entrance outside the hut,&#8221; said
the chief priest, curtly, to Cabanacte, &#8220;and bid
no one enter upon pain of death. Of what has
happened here, breathe not a word. Go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Crawling through the entrance, Cabanacte
drew himself erect in the sunlight, a sentry
against whose behests none of the chattering
sun-worshippers, who had poured into the square
to learn the meaning of the cry which had echoed
from Coyocop&#8217;s abode, dared protest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>&#8220;Say to the Brother of the Moon that what he
did was well done,&#8221; went on Coheyogo to Noco.
&#8220;If the draught which he made for the Great
Sun gives life as surely as his silver wand brings
death, then shall the shadow pass from our weeping
race. Go, then, Noco, to the temple quickly,
and bid four priests to hasten to me here.
Answer no questions, but, as you go, inform the
people that Coyocop has destroyed with flowers,
brought to her cabin by the faithful, the evil
spirit which strove to kill our king and bring
destruction upon the City of the Sun. Say to
them further, if they should whisper the name
of yonder chief, that Manatte has gone to the
foot-hills to offer prayers for the Great Sun&#8217;s life.
Go at once, for the day grows old and we have
much to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning toward de Sancerre, who had been
whispering to Do&ntilde;a Julia words of hope and
cheer, Coheyogo pointed to the feet of the dead
sun-prince, and then strode to the head of the
corpse. The Frenchman and the chief priest
raised the heavy body and placed it upon Do&ntilde;a
Julia&#8217;s reed-plaited bed. With armfuls of magnolia
blossoms Coheyogo covered Manatte&#8217;s face
and shoulders, while de Sancerre, comprehending
vaguely the scheme which the chief priest
had in mind, strewed flowers upon the trunk of
his sword&#8217;s gigantic prey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>&#8220;May God defend us!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I fear
the keenness of this crafty priest! He has an
agile mind. He turns a nightmare to a dream
of spring with most exquisite skill. And, for
some reason which I cannot find, he takes great
pleasure in this gay youth&#8217;s death. I trust that
Do&ntilde;a Julia has learned to read his mind. I
dread him either as an ally or a foe!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before de Sancerre could find an opportunity
for holding further converse with the Spanish
maiden, whose presence in the City of the Sun
had wellnigh restored his boyhood&#8217;s faith in
miracles, Noco, followed by four silent elders
from the temple of the sacred fire, had entered
the hut. A few moments later the voiceless,
expectant throng in the great square gazed with
awe and wonder upon a picturesque procession
which moved with slow and solemn tread from
Coyocop&#8217;s abode to the outskirts of the town,
beyond which point a word from the temple
priests prevented the dusky crowd from following
it.</p>

<p>At the head of the cort&egrave;ge walked the chief
priest, accompanied by de Sancerre, whose drawn
rapier gleamed like a sword of fire as the red
rays of the setting sun made a plaything of the
blade. Behind them came four white-robed bearers
carrying a plaited bier, upon which lay the body
of a tall man concealed from view by a trembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
shroud of fragrant flowers. Following
this strange funeral, upon which the sun-worshippers
gazed with awe-stricken eyes, as if they
looked upon a marvel wrought by spirits, hobbled
the aged Noco, mumbling to herself as she
grinned at a people for whose blind superstition
she had no respect. Cabanacte had remained
as sentry at Coyocop&#8217;s abode, to chafe under the
useless task consigned to him; for to him it
seemed more fitting that he should guard Katonah
than stand as sentinel before a cabin upon
which high heaven smiled.</p>

<p>When the cort&egrave;ge had reached the twilight
shadows outside the city, the chief priest gave a
few simple directions to the bearers of the corpse
and, accompanied by de Sancerre and Noco,
turned back toward the temple of the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me, se&ntilde;ora!&#8221; cried the Frenchman,
when they had reached the square, pointing
toward the Great Sun&#8217;s cabin. &#8220;Say to the
chief priest, Do&ntilde;a Noco, that you and I must
watch by the good King&#8217;s side to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; answered Coheyogo, as he listened
to the old crone&#8217;s words. &#8220;May the great
spirit grant you the skill to save his life. &#8217;Tis
best for you that he should live.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this significant hint, the chief priest
strode through the dusk toward the temple of
the sacred fire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Before de Sancerre and Noco had reached the
cabin in which the Brother of the Sun lay tossing
upon a feverish couch, the Frenchman, whose
mind was filled with the vision of a pale, dark-eyed
woman, garbed in black, with spring flowers
upon her breast, recalled, for an instant, another
face which seemed to accuse him in the twilight
there of strange forgetfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre, seizing
Noco by the arm at the very entrance to the
royal hut. &#8220;Katonah! It is not well to leave
her all alone. Go to your home and bring her
here at once. This town&#8217;s a seething cesspool of
dark-brown, white-robed treachery! <i>Peste!</i> If
harm should come to her, I dare not look into
the saintly Membr&eacute;&#8217;s good gray eyes again.
Come back at once. The Great Sun needs your
care.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words de Sancerre bent down to
enter the royal cabin, while Noco hurried away
to rescue Katonah from a lonely night.</p>

<small>IN WHICH DE SANCERRE WIELDS HIS SWORD AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> royal cabin was the largest and most pretentious
dwelling-house in the City of the Sun.
Its walls were made of mud, sand and moss, and,
hardened by time, had become both serviceable
and sightly. The roof was formed of grass and
reeds, united in a close embrace which defied the
most penetrating rain or hail. Forty feet square,
the main room of the palace&mdash;to give it a grandiloquent
name&mdash;was furnished in a style befitting
the exalted rank of its royal occupant. The
Great Sun&#8217;s throne was simple in construction,
being nothing more than a wooden stool four
feet in height, but its inherent significance was
indicated by the devices with which it had been
decorated by reverential and cunning hands.
Beneath the throne was stretched the rarest of
the King&#8217;s household furnishings, a carpet made
of costly furs, which, so tradition asserted, had
aroused the cupidity of a Spaniard in a former
generation, and still bore the stain of the lifeblood
which he had vainly paid in his effort to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
rob the feet of royalty of their most valued
luxury.</p>

<p>Audience-chamber, throne-room and sleeping-apartment,
the main hall of the Great Sun&#8217;s
abode, as de Sancerre entered it, after despatching
old Noco to her cabin in search of Katonah,
was a sight which might have delighted the eye
of an impressionable painter, but would have
aroused the temper of a conscientious housekeeper.
The Great Sun&#8217;s sudden illness had begotten
a confusion in the royal m&eacute;nage which
had transformed his abode from a picturesque
cabin into a disordered hospital.</p>

<p>The stricken chieftain lay tossing from side to
side upon a couch covered with painted and embroidered
deer-skins. As de Sancerre approached
his patient, a group of noisy women, the wives
of the Great Sun, fled toward the shadows at the
further end of the room. Following them, a
white-robed, soft-footed sun-worshipper, casting
a glance of malice at the Frenchman, deserted
the sick King&#8217;s side and stole away into the darkness.
The court physician, who, through the
chief priest&#8217;s influence, had been succeeded by de
Sancerre, had been availing himself of an opportunity
to observe the effects of the Frenchman&#8217;s
treatment upon the fever-racked scion of the sun.</p>

<p>Jealous of his prerogatives, but knowing that
a cruel death awaited him should the Great Sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
die, the royal physician had been torn by conflicting
emotions as he gazed down upon the restless
form of a chieftain whose bodily welfare had
been his care for many years. While he longed,
for the sake of his own safety, to see the King
restored to health, he harbored a professional
protest against the introduction to the royal
cabin of this alien moon-magic, which, after all,
seemed to consist in nothing more than the administration
to the patient of a few drops of a
liquid medicine at more or less regular intervals.</p>

<p>De Sancerre was not, in fact, jeopardizing his
life&mdash;more than ever of value to him since he
had solved the mystery of Coyocop&mdash;by risking
the recovery of the Great Sun upon an answer
to prayer, nor upon the chance that the royal
sun-worshipper&#8217;s strong constitution might resist
the attack of a sudden indisposition. The Frenchman,
upon his first visit to the chieftain&#8217;s cabin,
had quickly reached the conclusion that the Great
Sun had fallen a victim to over-excitement and
over-eating. De Sancerre&#8217;s experience in courts
and camps had long ago familiarized him with
the effects which follow a nervous strain accompanied
by excessive indulgence in food and
drink.</p>

<p>The Frenchman&#8217;s observant eye, trained in
many climes to harvest large crops of details,
had noted, as he approached the City of the Sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
through a semi-tropical forest, a tree whose
resinous inner bark vouchsafes to men a balsam
of great curative powers. It was from this tree&mdash;the
copal&mdash;that, obeying de Sancerre&#8217;s directions,
old Noco had obtained the ingredients for
a fever-quieting draught which had already begun
to exercise a beneficent influence upon the
Frenchman&#8217;s royal patient.</p>

<p>As he now gazed down questioningly at the
Great Sun, whose kingly bearing had been replaced
by that lack of dignity which an acute
fever begets even where royalty itself is concerned,
de Sancerre was rejoiced to discover that
his simple febrifuge had already produced the
effect which he had foreseen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks be to St. Maturin!&#8221; he muttered,
contentedly, glancing toward the end of the
room to which the King&#8217;s wives and the discomfited
court physician had withdrawn. &#8220;My surmise
was correct. The Great Sun was too hospitable
to the wandering moon. I have known
more enlightened monarchs, in more highly
civilized lands, to succumb to their excessive zeal
for good-fellowship. Quiet, care, and a few drops
of balsam are all that this old chief requires to
make him a king again from top to toe. <i>Nom
de Dieu</i>, another day like this one, and I&#8217;ll need
medicine myself! The r&ocirc;le of executioner is not
so bad, but a physician&mdash;<i>peste!</i> May the devil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
fly away with that chief priest! I fear me he&#8217;s
a snake. I should dare to hope that I might
rescue Do&ntilde;a Julia from this bloodthirsty land if
I could but trust that crafty Coheyogo, who&#8217;s as
keen as Richelieu and as slippery as Mazarin! I
must keep a sharp eye upon his reverence, or he
will yet cast his sacred cords around my neck!&#8221;</p>

<p>To de Sancerre, thus standing in silent revery
beside the Great Sun&#8217;s couch, came Noco, hobbling
from the entrance with hurried step. Her
appearance was greeted by a more insistent
chorus from the gossiping women at the end of
the room, to whom the outcome of their royal
husband&#8217;s illness meant either life or death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Katonah!&#8221; panted the old crone, as she
reached the Frenchman&#8217;s side. &#8220;She has disappeared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre. &#8220;You
know her not, se&ntilde;ora. She would not leave your
cabin without a word to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not blind!&#8221; cried Noco, angrily. &#8220;My
house is empty and the girl is gone. And Cabanacte&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of him?&#8221; asked de Sancerre, impatiently,
as Noco paused for breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him of Katonah&#8217;s flight, and he has
set out in search of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The traitor!&#8221; muttered the Frenchman, peering
down at the old hag who had brought to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
such unwelcome news. &#8220;Your grandson, Do&ntilde;a
Noco, has abandoned the spirit for the flesh&mdash;and
left Coyocop without a guard! Surely,
Katonah is safer in the forest than is the spirit
of the sun in a city which pretends to worship
her. I shall chide your grandson, Do&ntilde;a Noco, if
I ever look upon his giant form again. But
stay you here, se&ntilde;ora. When this great Son of
Suns awakens from his sleep give him a drink of
balsam&mdash;and he&#8217;ll sleep again. I go to Coyocop,
and will return anon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moon had not yet arisen, and darkness
and silence combined to cast a menacing spell
upon the impressionable City of the Sun. De
Sancerre&#8217;s spirits were at a low ebb as he groped
his way toward Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s unguarded cabin.
The reaction from a day of excitement had come
upon him, and the gloom of the deserted square
did not tend toward the restoration of his former
cheerfulness. It was true that he had escaped
death through a combination of circumstances
which apparently had won for him the good-will
of the chief priest, but the outlook for the
immediate future was not promising. De la
Salle could not return from the South for several
weeks, even if he and his followers escaped the
perils which might menace them as they approached
the mouth of the great river. Cabanacte,
to whom de Sancerre had looked for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
aid which might make his escape with the Spanish
girl possible, had betrayed friendship at the
instigation of a stronger passion. His return
from the forest might be long delayed. As he
approached the hut in which his grateful eyes
had rested upon the pale, sweet face of Julia de
Aquilar, de Sancerre felt a sinking of the heart,
a sensation of utter hopelessness which was an
unacceptable novelty to the vivacious Frenchman,
against whose sanguine temperament the
shafts of despair had heretofore been powerless.</p>

<p>As he stationed himself, with rapier in hand,
before the entrance to Coyocop&#8217;s sacred cabin,
there was nothing in his surroundings to relight
the flame of hope in de Sancerre&#8217;s soul.
Clouds had begun to darken the eastern sky,
revoking its promise of a moonlit night. A
moaning wind, damp and chill, had stolen from
its lair in the forest to annoy a fickle city with
its cold, moist kiss. The world seemed to be
made of sighs and shadows. The great square
in front of him, dark and deserted, strove to deceive
the Frenchman with its tale of an abandoned
town. Now and then the voice of some
devout sun-worshipper, raised in hoarse prayer,
would penetrate the walls of a hut and bear
witness to the city&#8217;s swarming life.</p>

<p>After a time there came upon de Sancerre the
impression that piercing black eyes watched him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
as he strode up and down in front of the silent,
shadow-haunted hut in which the strange chances
of life had imprisoned the only woman who had
ever aroused in his mocking soul the precious
passion of romantic love. He cut the darkness
with his eager glance, but suspicion was not replaced
by certainty. Nevertheless, the feeling
grew strong within him that the night wind
toyed with white robes not far away, and that
stealthy footsteps reached his ears on either hand.</p>

<p>By a strong effort of will, de Sancerre routed
the sensation of mingled consternation and impotence
which the chill gloom and the presence
of prying spies had begotten, and, drawing close
to the doorway of Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s cabin, hummed
an ancient love-ballad born of the troubadours.
The song had died in the damp embrace of the
roving wind when the silence was broken by a
voice which reached de Sancerre&#8217;s grateful ears
from the entrance to the hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak not in Spanish and in whispers only,
Mademoiselle de Aquilar!&#8221; exclaimed the Frenchman
in a low voice, not changing his attitude
of a swordsman doing duty as a sentinel. &#8220;There
are listening ears upon all sides of me. If we
converse in French, they&#8217;ll think we use the
tongue of sun or moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard your voice, monsieur. Is there great
danger if we talk a while?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>&#8220;I hardly know,&#8221; answered de Sancerre, striving
again to read the secrets of the night. &#8220;But
listen, for when the chance may come to me to
speak to you again I do not know. Be ready at
any moment, at a word from me, to leave this
hut. I&#8217;ll use old Noco for my messenger, when
I have made my plans. I dare not flee with you
to-night, for, as I speak, I see the ghostly menace
of a skulking temple priest. There&#8217;d be no
safety for us beyond the town. Alas, we must
abide our time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, oh, my heart is light, monsieur,&#8221; whispered
the girl, from whose Spanish tongue the
French words made rich music as they fell. &#8220;If
this be not a dream, it cannot be that you have
come in vain. One night I heard my father&#8217;s
voice in Paradise. He spoke to me of you, and
when old Noco told me that by the river there
were white-faced men, I heard his voice again&mdash;and
wrote my name upon the bark. It is a
miracle, monsieur!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A miracle, indeed!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre,
chafing under the tyranny of his grim surroundings
and distrustful of an overpowering inclination
to bend down and clasp the girl&#8217;s hand in
his. &#8220;But the devil and the sun-priests, mademoiselle,
are in league against us. Pray to the
saints that we may foil them both! <i>Ma foi</i>, a
half-done miracle is worse than none! But this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
I promise you, that whether you and I be playthings
of a heartless Fate, or the favored wards
of Mother Mary and her Son, I&#8217;ll plot and scheme
and fight until I save you from captivity, or pay
the price of death. And so, good-night! I dare
not let you linger longer where you are, for already
these white-robed spies are growing restless
at our talk, and I hear them muttering in
the darkness there, as if in resentment of my
converse with their deity.&#8221;</p>

<p>A suppressed sob told de Sancerre how much
his presence meant to the lonely girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we not leave this awful place at once?&#8221;
she moaned. &#8220;Forgive me, monsieur, but it has
been so long since I have seen a ray of hope in
this black hole that every moment since I knew
that you were here has seemed a year. May
Mother Mary guard you through the night!
&#8217;Tis well I love my prayers, monsieur! I will
not sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, mademoiselle, &#8217;tis well to pray, but not
to lose your sleep. You&#8217;ll need the saints, anon&mdash;but
also strength. Sleep, Do&ntilde;a Julia, for the
love of&mdash;God! And so, good-night! I&#8217;ll watch
beside your door until these slinking scoundrels
have gone to feed their sacred fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>No sound save the complaining of the restless
wind broke the stillness of the night, which had
grown blacker as its age increased. Suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
de Sancerre, as agile as a cat, sprang forward,
barely in time to escape the clutch of remorseless
arms. Turning, like a thunderbolt he drove
his sword through a white-robed night-prowler,
who died at his feet without a groan. So sudden
and noiseless had been the attack and its
fatal defence that it had not recalled Do&ntilde;a Julia
to the entrance to the hut. On the instant, old
Noco grasped de Sancerre by the arm, and, turning
in anger, the Frenchman found himself confronted
by Coheyogo.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve killed another snake, se&ntilde;ora!&#8221; exclaimed
de Sancerre, grimly, pointing to a white mass at
his feet. &#8220;Will you say to the chief priest, Do&ntilde;a
Noco, that I should more highly prize his friendship
if he kept his temple priests from off my
back?&#8221;</p>

<p>Coheyogo muttered a few words to the aged
interpreter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man you&#8217;ve slain has been rebellious and
deserves his fate. He disobeyed a strict command,&#8221;
said Noco, repeating the chief priest&#8217;s
curt comment. &#8220;He&#8217;ll place a guard of trusty
priests before the door of Coyocop, that you and
I may seek the Great Sun&#8217;s side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How kind he is!&#8221; muttered do Sancerre,
petulantly. &#8220;A pretty plight this is for a Count
of Languedoc! I&#8217;m tired of this Coheyogo&#8217;s
domineering ways! But still, I dare not cross<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
him now. Come, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; he exclaimed in Spanish,
turning toward the King&#8217;s cabin and groping
his way through the black night. &#8220;I trust my
sword will find no more to do to-night! It has
had a busy day!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>IN WHICH THE CITY OF THE SUN ENJOYS A F&Ecirc;TE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> moon of strawberries had been succeeded
by the moon of old corn, and there was joy in
the land of the sun-worshippers. In other words,
the month of April had gone by and the month
of May had found the Great Sun&#8217;s grateful subjects
making ready to celebrate his restoration
to health by national games and a thanksgiving
feast.</p>

<p>The laggard weeks had told many a flattering
tale of hope to Count Louis de Sancerre, but at
the end of a month&#8217;s sojourn in the City of the
Sun he still found himself, in all essential particulars,
a helpless stranger in a fickle and jealous
land, honored by the Great Sun and the chief
priest, and admired by the people, but closely
watched by sharp black eyes, from which flashed
gleams of malice and suspicion. Impatient and
impetuous though he was, the Frenchman dared
not force the issue to a crisis. Easy of accomplishment
as the kidnapping of Coyocop seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
to be, de Sancerre realized that he would rush
to certain death if he took a false step and attempted
a rescue hampered by his ignorance of
the surrounding country and of the movements
of Sieur de la Salle. Day succeeded day and no
word came from the river to the pale and haggard
Frenchman, whose only joy in life during those
dreary weeks sprang from the voice of Julia de
Aquilar, which reached his grateful ears now and
then as he prowled around her cabin late at night.
Even this source of delight he was obliged to
forego after a time, receiving from the chief
priest a broad hint regarding the dangers which
menaced a stranger in the town after dark, and
learning from Noco that Coheyogo had discovered
in the temple the existence of a fanatical faction
among the sun-priests which had sworn to overcome
de Sancerre&#8217;s moon-magic by physical
force.</p>

<p>But it was Cabanacte&#8217;s failure to return from
his quest of Katonah that had wound the strongest
cord around the Frenchman&#8217;s hands. Could
he have had the giant&#8217;s assistance at this crisis,
de Sancerre felt confident that any one of a number
of schemes which he had been obliged to reject
for lack of an ally could have been forced
to the goal of success. But Cabanacte had disappeared,
had made no further sign, and old
Noco, to whom her grandson was as an open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
book, had said sadly to de Sancerre that the
youth would not return.</p>

<p>The restless and wellnigh discouraged Frenchman
had, through his success as a physician, won
the enthusiastic gratitude of the Great Sun, who
had insisted upon making his Brother of the
Moon the honored guest of the royal cabin, within
which de Sancerre was compelled, much against
his will, to spend the major portion of the time,
talking to the convalescent king by the aid of
Noco&#8217;s nimble tongue.</p>

<p>It was the dawn of a cloudless day near the
middle of the moon of old corn when de Sancerre,
opening his eyes after a night of dreamless,
restful sleep, enjoyed, for a moment, that sensation
of physical well-being which suggests the
possibility that nature harbors no enmity to man.
Outside the royal cabin the morning vibrated
with the melody of birds and the distant rumors
of a forest springing gladly into life. There was
movement and bustle inside the hut, and de Sancerre
turned lazily upon his gayly-bedecked couch
to watch the Great Sun as he paid homage to his
risen god. With a spotless white robe flowing
from his royal shoulders, the King, still feeble
from his recent illness, stood in the centre of the
room gravely lighting his calumet from a live
ember which one of his wives held out to
him. Then striding toward the dawn-beset exit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
to the cabin, which led straight to the rising
sun, the convalescent chief blew three puffs of
tobacco-smoke toward the deified orb of day.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Pardieu</i>,&#8221; muttered de Sancerre, &#8220;if they
would but sacrifice more tobacco and less blood
to their shining god, this city would not be so repulsive
to a man of tender heart.&#8221; The Frenchman
had thrown his slim legs over the side of
the plaited bed and sat gazing at the Sun-Chief
with a quizzical smile upon his clean-cut, thin and
colorless face. Suddenly upon the air of morning
arose the shouts of a joyful multitude approaching
the Great Sun&#8217;s cabin. As if born of
the dawn, the noisy throng poured into the
square, carrying to the palace of their king offerings
of fruit, flowers, vegetables, meats and fish.
Into the cabin crowded the smiling, chattering
sun-worshippers, their white teeth gleaming and
their black eyes flashing fire as they piled their
gifts around the Great Sun&#8217;s hand-painted throne,
interfering with de Sancerre&#8217;s toilet but treating
him with the respect due to a son of the full
moon, in whose magic they had reason to rejoice.
A noisy, picturesque, light-hearted crowd, delighting
in the escape of their king from death,
and in the postponement of the general slaughter
of men, women, and children which would have
followed his demise, they impressed the Frenchman
as overgrown, frolicsome, unreliable children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
beneath whose gayety lurked the capacity for
bloody mischief.</p>

<p>Half-dressed and somewhat weary of the glad
uproar, de Sancerre, having withdrawn to a distant
corner of the hut, stood watching a ceremony
which was destined to replenish the royal
larder, when he felt a tug at his arm, and, looking
down, met the keen eyes of Noco.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis from Coyocop,&#8221; she muttered, slipping
into his hand a piece of mulberry bark. The
corner in which he stood was not well-lighted,
but de Sancerre was able, at length, to decipher
the scrawl made by Julia de Aquilar. Her words
were few:</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat no fish at to-day&#8217;s banquet,&#8221; ran the message.
De Sancerre glanced down at the old hag
questioningly, but there was nothing in her face
to suggest that she understood the warning which
had been scratched upon the bark. The moment
seemed to be ripe for putting into operation a
plan upon which de Sancerre&#8217;s mind had been at
work for several days.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; he said, observing with
satisfaction that no prying eyes were fixed upon
them at that moment, &#8220;would it please you to
find your grandson, Cabanacte, and lure him
from the forest to his home?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a gleam in her small, black eyes as
they met his which assured de Sancerre that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
had pressed a finger upon the beldame&#8217;s dearest
wish.</p>

<p>&#8220;It cannot be done,&#8221; she croaked, turning her
back to him as if about to mingle with the laughing
throng. De Sancerre seized her by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Noco,&#8221; he urged, bending down to
whisper eager Spanish into her old ears. &#8220;Coyocop
and I, going to the forest side by side, could
find Cabanacte and the maiden from the north.
Tell this to Coyocop, that I will come to her
when the banquet nears its end at dark. I leave
the rest to you, for you must lead us from the
city to the woods. The moon of old corn will
give us light to-night to find your grandson in
the forest glades or where the river floweth toward
the sea. Will you take my word to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Si, se&ntilde;or</i>,&#8221; muttered Noco, gazing up at de
Sancerre with eyes which strove to read his very
soul. &#8220;But if we fail&mdash;if Coyocop is missed&mdash;it
will be death for you and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot fail, se&ntilde;ora, for the full moon is
my god! We&#8217;ll find your Cabanacte ere the
night is old&mdash;and none will ever know. And
now, begone! Between the setting of the sun
and the rising of the moon I&#8217;ll come to you and
Coyocop. Be true to me, se&ntilde;ora, and by the
magic of my silver wand you&#8217;ll look upon your
grandson&#8217;s face to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another moment Noco, eluding the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
Sun&#8217;s glance as she stole between the tall sun-worshippers,
had crept from the cabin into the
rosy light of day.</p>

<p>The hours which followed her departure passed
like long days to de Sancerre. He watched the
Great Sun&#8217;s wives as they became surfeited with
the petty tyranny which they exercised at the
expense of a throng of lesser women, upon whom
rested the drudgery necessitated by the approaching
feast. Cares of state&mdash;an inventory of the
tribute paid to his divine right&mdash;occupied the
attention of the King until noon had long been
passed and left de Sancerre to his own devices.
Seated at the entrance to the cabin, the Frenchman
could observe what was passing in the sunny
square outside, while he still kept an eye upon
the Great Sun and his busy household. Half-naked
boys and girls, gay with garlands of
flowers, were arranging long lines of wooden
benches in front of the royal dwelling under the
direction of a master of ceremonies who had
escaped death with his king.</p>

<p>The bench upon which the Great Sun, the chief
priest, and de Sancerre, the nation&#8217;s guest, were
to sit stood just in front of the King&#8217;s cabin, and
had been covered with painted skins and surrounded
by a carpet of magnolia blossoms.</p>

<p>As the hour for the banquet approached the
nobly-born sun-worshippers gathered in groups<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
at the further end of the square, awaiting a signal
from royalty to seat themselves upon the
benches, hot by this time from the glare of a
cloudless day. Gayety, suppressed but impatient,
reigned in the City of the Sun. Black
eyes flashed above smiling lips, and now and
then a chorus of happy voices would raise a
chant in praise of a deity who had blessed the
earth with fecund warmth. Even the stealthy,
silent, keen-eyed temple priests failed to cast a
damper upon the joyous children of the sun as
they mingled with the throng or lurked in the
shadow of their skull-crowned palisade.</p>

<p>The banquet had been under way for more
than an hour before de Sancerre, seated between
the Great Sun and Coheyogo, had been able to
revive the hope which had sprung up in his breast
earlier in the day. His environment, as it met
his eyes at the outset of the feast, seemed to preclude
all possibility of a successful issue to the
plan which he had impulsively put into operation.
A group of plebeians, watching the nobility as it
made merry&mdash;apparently at the King&#8217;s expense,
but, in reality, at theirs&mdash;stood directly in front
of Coyocop&#8217;s abode and were laughingly driving
de Sancerre&#8217;s heart into his pointed shoes. Would
the gaping throng disperse as the sun sank low
in the sky, and leave to the Frenchman one
chance in a thousand for the triumph of his daring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
scheme? The hours, as they passed, left de
Sancerre less and less self-confident, while they
increased the joyous hilarity of the feasters
among whom he sat. The mud-made walls of
the houses on either side of him had begun to
throw long shadows across the square before de
Sancerre was able to cull from his surroundings
a bud of hope. It sprang from the tongue of
Noco, who, as she passed behind his back, muttered
in Spanish:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will touch your arm at dark. Then follow
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment the women serving the royal
table placed before the Great Sun and his guests
of honor bits of bark upon which rested fish still
hissing from the heat of a wood-fire. De Sancerre,
who had turned to nod to Noco, caught a
gleam of excitement in the black eyes of the
serving-woman who had stretched her scrawny,
brown arms between him and the chief priest.
As he faced the feast again the fish in front of
him recalled the written warning which he had
received that morning from Julia de Aquilar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Touch no fish at to-day&#8217;s banquet,&#8221; repeated
de Sancerre to himself. &#8220;&#8217;Twas good advice, I
think. I&#8217;ll let this schemer, Coheyogo, eat my
dish.&#8221; Acting upon the impulse of the moment,
the Frenchman touched the chief priest upon the
arm, and, as Coheyogo&#8217;s black eyes met his, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
made a gesture toward the retreating form of
Noco, as if he invoked the aid of the temple to
recall the interpreter to his side. The spontaneity
of de Sancerre&#8217;s action had its effect
upon the sun-priest, for he turned instantly and
called aloud to the double-tongued and two-faced
hag. With a rapidity and deftness worthy of a
prestidigitateur, do Sancerre transposed the fragments
of fish-laden bark upon the bench, and,
as Coheyogo resumed his former attitude, he was
confronted, unknowingly, with a dish with which
a fanatical but disobedient priest, hating moon-magic,
had tampered.</p>

<p>There is but short shrift given to the day when
the sun deserts it in southern climes. Twilight
had already begun to cast a gloom upon the
feast, against which the forced gayety begotten
of cinnamon-flavored wine could not prevail,
when de Sancerre again felt old Noco&#8217;s touch
upon his arm. Before he turned to her the
Frenchman, whose heart was beating wildly beneath
his rusty velvets, cast a glance at the Great
Sun. To his great satisfaction he discovered that
his royal patient had wholly disregarded the
warning vouchsafed by his recent illness and
had been indulging in the pleasures of the table
to an extent that had placed again in jeopardy
the lives of those of his subjects who were
doomed to accompany him in state to the spirit-land.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
But it was the condition of Coheyogo at
that moment which gave to de Sancerre the
greater cause for joy. The chief priest sat
blinking down at a half-eaten fish, as if he
struggled vainly to read the grim secret which
it held. Now and then his head would drop
forward as if he had been overcome by sleep.
Then, by an effort of will, he would straighten
his spine and attempt to collect his thoughts.
The Frenchman watched him searchingly for a
moment, and observed with delight that the
struggle which the chief priest was making
against a slothful but resistless foe would end
in full defeat.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>,&#8221; muttered de Sancerre, as he crawled
softly from between the intoxicated State and
the bedrugged Church into the shadow into which
Noco had stolen, &#8220;had I not learned a trick or
two in camps, &#8217;tis I who would be nodding, not
Coheyogo. I would I could remain to see the
outcome of this contest between a poison and a
snake!&#8221;</p>

<p>Noco had grasped him by the arm, and in
another instant de Sancerre found himself stealing
toward Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s cabin through the darkest
corner of the crowded square. Either the
saints or the moon-god, or senseless chance,
granted the Frenchman favors at that crucial
hour; for, as he approached Coyocop&#8217;s sacred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
abode, wellnigh hidden from sight beneath hillocks
of cut flowers, a group of enthusiasts at
the feast, still unconquered by the fermented
juice of the cassia-berry, had mounted the food-stained
benches and raised a maudlin, monotonous
chant, in which the onlooking plebeians accompanied
them. At the same moment a crowd
of boys and girls at the further end of the square
had begun a weird, ungraceful, unseemly dance, in
which, as time passed, men and women joined with
shouts of wild laughter. Presently the kettle-drum
added its barbaric clamor to the din which
fretted the darkness as it crept across the disordered
square. Even the sun-priests, heated by
the epidemic of gayety which had seized the
town, had left their sacred fire to the care of a
chosen few, and were now mingling with the
shouting, dancing, delirious multitude upon a
pretext of good-fellowship, which was not too
well received.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait here, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; whispered Noco, in a guttural
voice which shook with excitement, pushing
de Sancerre against the wall at the rear of
Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s hut. &#8220;Don&#8217;t stir until I return.
I fear some priest may still be watching me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old crone disappeared around the corner
of the cabin, and de Sancerre stood, trying to
swallow his insistent heart, as he listened to the
uproar in the square and, presently, to the voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
of Julia de Aquilar whispering to Noco almost
at his very side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; hissed Noco, at his shoulder, seizing
him by the wrist, and dragging Do&ntilde;a Julia
toward the black shelter of the forest by the
other hand. &#8220;No word! No rest! There will
be no safety for us until we reach the trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Followed through the gloom by the harsh discord
of a mad town&#8217;s revelry, Do&ntilde;a Julia de
Aquilar, of Seville, and Count Louis de Sancerre,
of Languedoc, linked together by a wrinkled beldame,
who looked at that moment like a grinning
witch escaping to the wilds with the helpless
victims of her spite, hurried, with hearts
growing lighter with every step, toward a pathless
wilderness, in which a thousand lurking perils
would menace them at every turn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<small>IN WHICH DE SANCERRE UNDERGOES MANY VARIED<br />
EMOTIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> full moon of May, the moon of old corn,
shone down upon a virgin forest bounding with
the high pulse of a ripe spring-time. Its white
splendor tiptoed along the outskirts of impenetrable
thickets, or danced gayly down majestic
glades, patrolled by oak and hickory, sassafras,
and poplar trees. Presently, shunning a menacing
morass, the silvery outriders of the moon&#8217;s
array would file along a narrow bayou or charge
<i>en masse</i> across the broad surface of a trembling
lake. And while the triumphant moonlight took
possession of a splendid province, the thousand
voices of the forest murmured at midnight a
welcome to the conqueror.</p>

<p>Panting for breath, and worn with the friction
of their race for freedom through swamps
and woods, de Sancerre and his companions,
after long hours of hurried flight, paused to
recover their strength, far to the southward of
the City of the Sun. The marvellous endurance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
of Julia de Aquilar, whose urgency had granted
to the enraged Noco no chance to protest against
the fervor of their mad career, had put even the
wiry, hardened frame of the lithe Frenchman
to a stubborn test. Hand in hand de Sancerre
and the Spanish girl had sped onward, followed
by the grumbling crone, now breaking their way
through vindictive underbrush, anon wetting their
feet in marshy vales, again making progress beneath
stately trees, avoiding the deep gloom of
threatening recesses and following a moon-track,
like hounds upon a scent. Behind them sat certain
death; beyond them, a joyful promise lured
them deeper and ever deeper into the primeval
wilds.</p>

<p>Tottering and breathless, old Noco reached
the crest of the tree-crowned hillock upon which
Do&ntilde;a Julia and de Sancerre, gasping, speechless,
but strong with renewed hope, stood awaiting
her coming. Throwing her old bones upon the
damp grass, Noco lay moaning for a time in senile
misery. Youth, under the spurs of fear and
hope, had led old age a cruel race. Noco had
come into the forest to solve by moon-magic
the secret of her grandson&#8217;s flight, and, lo! the
wizard upon whom she relied had become a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp,
in tattered velvets, using his diabolical
power to kidnap Coyocop, the spirit of the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lean against the tree-trunk, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; said de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Sancerre to Do&ntilde;a Julia, his voice tripping over
his breath as he spoke. &#8220;I fear old Noco has
found our pace too hot. But, even now, I dare
not rest. We must go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Descending the hillock to the treacherous ooze
which mirrored the moon in a multitude of pools,
the Frenchman filled his bedraggled bonnet with
cold water and returned quickly to Noco&#8217;s side.
Bending down, he forced the panting beldame to
drink deep of the refreshing draught. Then he
poured a cold stream upon her drawn, dusky face
and through the white hair above her wrinkled
brow. The old hag&#8217;s beady eyes had watched
his every movement. Had he not cast a spell
upon the moon-kissed water with which he laved
her head? Surely this revival of her strength,
which raised her on the instant to her feet, was
magical. Cruel though he might have been to
her, the Brother of the Moon was making full
reparation with his witchery for the suffering
which she had undergone. Old Noco was more
superstitious at midnight than at dawn, more a
savage in the forest than in her city hut. The
mocking gleam which her eyes had known so
well the moonlight could not find, as she stood
facing de Sancerre, gazing up at him with a
question in her glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cabanacte?&#8221; she exclaimed, still short of
breath.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>&#8220;We will seek him by the river,&#8221; answered
de Sancerre, pointing to a break in the forest
which opened toward the east, as he drew the
woman toward the hollow gum-tree against
which the Spanish girl was seated, silently pouring
out her soul in gratitude to Mother Mary
and the saints.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is no time,&#8221; complained the old
woman. &#8220;They will miss Coyocop, and if they
find us in the woods&mdash;ugh!&#8221; The grunt of
horror to which Noco gave vent bore witness to
how much cruelty her aged eyes had gazed upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Do&ntilde;a Noco,&#8221; said de Sancerre sternly,
as he extended his hand to Julia de Aquilar and,
indulging in a courtly flourish wholly out of keeping
with his environment, drew her to her feet,
&#8220;we have set out to find Katonah and your
grandson. Be true to Cabanacte and put your
trust in Coyocop. Listen, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; and here
de Sancerre bent down and addressed the old
crone with impressive emphasis, &#8220;as we hurry
on, ponder the words I speak; the City of the
Sun is unworthy of the spirit sent from God.
It is accursed. Its temple runs with blood, and
its vile priests have sealed the city&#8217;s doom. Come;
&#8217;twas your grandson who found Coyocop. &#8217;Tis
Coyocop who shall now find Cabanacte.&#8221;</p>

<p>Onward through the moonlit forest the trio
kept their course, tending always toward a noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
river that might bear them, could they build a
raft, to the vagrant camp of de la Salle, pitched
somewhere further south. Wasting no breath in
futile words, de Sancerre maintained a telling
pace which carried them every moment further
from a city of murder toward a stream where
hunger menaced them.</p>

<p>For two long, heavy hours they struggled eastward
across the treacherous margin of a river
grown erratic from its weary longing for the sea.
Now and then de Sancerre would turn to refresh
his straining eyes with a vision of beauty, done
in black and white against the moonlight, and,
for all time, upon his heart. A word of encouragement
would escape from his dry lips at
intervals, and a smile of hope and gratitude
would reward him for his prodigality of breath.</p>

<p>The want and hardship which confronted them,
the chances of capture from savage tribes, of
death from starvation, or swamp-begotten fever,
although clear to de Sancerre&#8217;s mind, could not,
in that glad hour, cast a shadow upon his buoyant
spirits. &#8220;A half-done miracle is worse than
none,&#8221; he had said to Do&ntilde;a Julia. It gave him
renewed confidence in the future to feel that
upon his own courage, pertinacity, and foresight
would depend the happy outcome of a strange
adventure which chance, at the outset, had made
possible. It was pleasant to de Sancerre to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
reflect that he could now relieve the saints of
all responsibility for the issue of events.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Frenchman uttered a word
of gratitude to St. Maturin, who watches over
fools, when, about two hours after midnight, he
and his companions shook the forest from their
weary shoulders and stood upon the curving
shore of the River Colbert&mdash;known to later times
as the Mississippi. De Sancerre&#8217;s quick eye saw
at once that at this point Sieur de la Salle had,
weeks before, made his camp for a night. By a
short cut through the woods, the Frenchman had
reached a point upon the river to gain which
the canoes of the great explorer had labored for
a day upon the winding stream. That the litter
left upon the bank had not been abandoned by a
party of roving Indians was proven beyond peradventure
to do Sancerre by a discovery which
electrified his pulse and renewed his admiration
for the saint whom he had just invoked. As he
hurried down the slope which fell gently from
the forest to the stream, anxious to enter the deserted
huts, made of reeds and leafy branches by
expert hands to serve as shelter for a single night,
de Sancerre&#8217;s torn shoes struck against an object
which forced an exclamation of astonishment
and delight from his ready tongue.</p>

<p>Gleaming in the moonlight at his feet, the
long barrel of a flintlock musket pointed straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
at a powder-horn and a bag of bullets, as if the
weapon, lacking nourishment, prayed to be recharged.
Bending down, de Sancerre raised the
clumsy gun and examined its mechanism with
the eagerness of a shipwrecked mariner toward
whose raft the sea had tossed a chest which
might, when opened, gladden his eyes with food.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia and Noco stood behind the Frenchman
watching his movements with eyes in which
curiosity had conquered the heaviness of dire
fatigue.</p>

<p>&#8220;This, Mademoiselle de Aquilar,&#8221; explained
de Sancerre, balancing the heavy musket in his
hand, &#8220;is the <i>fusil ordinaire</i>, or snaphance gun.
I have heard young hotspurs in the low countries&mdash;who
knew little of the rapier&#8217;s niceties&mdash;assert
that, at close quarters, its butt-end is more deadly
than a sword. Of its merits in a <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> I am not
ripe to speak, but I learned, while yet I lingered
with Count Frontenac, to drive a bullet through
a distant tree. The weapon has its use! You
may thank the saints, mademoiselle, for this gun
and powder-horn. &#8217;Twill serve my turn if my
captain&#8217;s careless redmen have left no eatables
in yonder huts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well I knew, monsieur, you had not
come to me in vain!&#8221; exclaimed Do&ntilde;a Julia, a
glad smile gleaming in her eloquent eyes, beneath
which rested the dark shadows of physical exhaustion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
&#8220;The saints have led your steps to
where the musket lay!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mais, oui!</i> But tell not Noco this. Her
ears must harken to another tale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning to gaze down at the silent beldame,
the fiery brightness of whose busy eyes the
strain of a forced march at midnight had not
dimmed, &#8217;though her face twitched with fatigue
and her scrawny hands shook in the moonlight,
de Sancerre said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Brother of the Moon is glad, se&ntilde;ora, for
my god has put into my hands the thunder and
the lightning&mdash;to call Cabanacte from the wilds
and to smite the sun-priests if they follow us.
To-morrow I will make the echoes of the forest
lead your grandson to us here. But now we
must have rest, for Coyocop is weary, and the
dawn must find us up.&#8221;</p>

<p>St. Maturin, the friend of fools, still played
de Sancerre&#8217;s game. As the Frenchman, followed
by the women, to whom each step they
took was now a hardship, entered the nearest
hut, he saw at once that his withdrawal from de
la Salle&#8217;s expedition, and the loss of Chat&eacute;muc
and Katonah, had led the explorer to lighten his
equipment by the contents of one canoe, intending,
doubtless, to retake the stores upon his return
should circumstances make them again of
value to him. A boat-load of corn-meal and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
gunpowder had been stored in the hut in the
hope that neither the weather nor roving savages
would deprive the returning explorers of its use.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Nom de Dieu!</i>&#8221; cried the Frenchman, gayly,
as he pointed to the godsend which made
his light heart lighter. &#8220;There lie food and
ammunition. &#8217;Tis true, indeed, that Heaven has
been kind to us! And so I leave you, Mademoiselle
de Aquilar, to your prayers and sleep. I
must make further search.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Noco, who had paid out the last link of
her energy, had made a shake-down of the meal-bags,
and her labored breathing proved that her
aged bones were finding the rest they craved.
De Sancerre held Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s cold, trembling
hand in his and gazed upon her weary face for a
long moment, whose very silence was eloquent
with words he could not speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, monsieur,&#8221; faltered the girl, tears
born of gratitude and physical weariness dimming
the dark beauty of her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; he said, bending to touch her
white hand with his lips. Then he drew himself
erect, trembling as if the damp breeze from the
river had chilled his overwrought frame. Suddenly
he clasped the weeping girl to his breast,
and his lips met hers in a kiss which crowned the
miracle the saints had wrought for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;My love! My love!&#8221; whispered de Sancerre;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
and when he reached the moonlit night outside
the hut again it seemed to him that the river
and the forest had changed their outlines to his
eyes and that he stood within the confines of a
paradise. He seated himself upon the sloping
margin of the stream, vainly attempting to recall
his soaring thoughts to the homely exigencies of
his grim environment. It was no paradise by
which he was surrounded. A lonely flood finding
its way to a lonely sea lay before his eyes,
while at his back stood a pathless wilderness
through which, even at this moment, black-hearted
fanatics, skilled in woodcraft, might be
following his trail. This dark thought, clouding
the splendor of a dream begotten by a kiss, led
de Sancerre, almost unconsciously, to take from
the ground at his side the awkward musket with
which chance had armed him. He longed to
test its prowess as an ally, to prove to his troubled
mind that dampness and neglect had not robbed
the flintlock of its heritage. With no intention
of giving way to the curiosity which assailed him,
the Frenchman carefully loaded the gun with
powder and ball and raised it affectionately to
his shoulder. In that hour of peril and loneliness
the musket seemed to be a friend speaking to
him of de la Salle&#8217;s loyalty and persistence and
of the certainty that his return from the gulf
could not be long delayed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>Suddenly an uncanny premonition crept over
de Sancerre, whose nervous energy had been exhausted
by a day and night of strangely-contrasted
emotions and by a physical strain whose
reaction was now taking its revenge. Turning
his back to the river, de Sancerre&#8217;s restless eyes
swept the black, threatening line of the forest,
behind which the moon was drooping. Presently
his heart seemed to clutch his throat and the
long barrel of the musket trembled as his hand
shook for an instant. At the edge of the woods,
two hundred yards beyond the camp, stood a
white, naked thing, resembling in outline a man,
but as shadowy and ghostly as a creature made
of moonbeams. It stood erect for a moment and
then bent down as if it would crawl back into
the forest upon all fours.</p>

<p>Impulsively, de Sancerre covered the apparition
with his gun and snapped the steel against the
flint. A crash, echoing across the startled flood,
and hurled back in anger by the bushes and the
trees, made sudden war upon the silence of the
stately night. When the smoke from the friendly
gun&mdash;in good case to serve the Frenchman&#8217;s
ends&mdash;had cleared away, de Sancerre saw no
ghastly victim of his marksmanship lying in
white relief against the black outline of the
woods. &#8220;Mayhap,&#8221; he reflected, &#8220;my bullet
passed through a shadow not of earth! Don<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
Joseph? Perhaps I drew him back from hell
with that dear kiss I won! But what mad
thoughts are these? &#8217;Twas but a gray wolf
in the scrub, or a vision raised by my own
weariness. At all events, <i>ma petite</i>,&#8221; he exclaimed,
patting the smoking musket contentedly,
&#8220;there&#8217;s now no doubt that you and I
agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>A soft touch fell upon de Sancerre&#8217;s arm, and,
turning, he looked into the white, agitated face
of Do&ntilde;a Julia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear not, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; he exclaimed, earnestly.
&#8220;Forgive me that I disturbed your rest. But it
seemed best to me to try the temper of this
clumsy gun. &#8217;Tis always well to know how
great may be the prowess of an ally whom you
have gained.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her dark eyes were reading his face closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have not found us?&#8221; she asked, eagerly.
&#8220;You did not shoot at men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only at a target made by dreams,&#8221; he answered,
reassuringly. &#8220;I shot at the phantom
of my hate, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>, and, lo! it brought my
love to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her dark eyes fell until their long black lashes
rested against her white face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You love me, se&ntilde;or?&#8221; she whispered, in a
voice which filled his soul with an ecstasy it had
never known before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>And once again the waters of the listening
river bore a love-tale to the distant gulf&mdash;a
strange, sweet sequel to gossip which the waves
had heard before.</p>

<small>IN WHICH SPIRITS, GOOD AND BAD, BESET A<br />
WILDERNESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cabanacte&#8217;s</span> wooing of Katonah, an idyl of
the forest, a love-poem lost in the wilds, a spring
song set to halting words, had filled two simple
lives with sadness through days of wandering
and nights of melancholy dreams. When the
stalwart sun-worshipper had first overtaken the
girl, fleeing she knew not whither, and inspired
by a motive which she could not analyze, Cabanacte
had been greeted by a faint, apathetic smile
which had aroused in his heart the hope that, as
time went by, her eyes might look into his with
the light of a great happiness shining in their
depths.</p>

<p>As the days and nights came and went and
returned again, while a glad world chanted the
wedding-song of spring, and the forest whispered
the gossip of the mating-time, Cabanacte&#8217;s gentleness
brought peace without passion, affection
without encouragement, into Katonah&#8217;s gaze as
it rested upon the dark, strong, kindly face of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
the dusky youth. Reclining at her feet for hours
at a time, the bronze giant would attempt to tell
the story of his love to the Mohican maiden in
broken Spanish, only a few words of which Katonah
understood. But what mattered the tongue
in which he spoke? The moon of old corn was
at the full, and the universe grew eloquent with
a language which every living creature comprehended.
The birds were singing in the trees
from a libretto which the squirrels and chipmunks
knew by heart. The wild flowers blushed
at a romance buzzed by bees, and from the grass
and the waters and the forest glades arose a
myriad of voices repeating the ballad of that
gayest of all troubadours, the spring-time of the
South.</p>

<p>Cabanacte&#8217;s wooing assumed many varying
forms. As a huntsman he would lay the trophies
of his skill at Katonah&#8217;s feet. He would
lure a fish from a stream, and, making a fire by
rubbing wood against a stone, would serve to her
a tempting dish upon a platter made of bark.
Wild plums, yellow or red, berries luscious with
the essence of the sunshine, and ripe, sweet figs
served as seductive foils to the burnt-offerings
which he placed upon the altar of his love.</p>

<p>Hand in hand they would wander aimlessly
through the flower-scented woods by day, silent
for hours at a time and soothed into contentment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
by a barbaric indifference to what the future
might have in store for them. At night Katonah
would sleep beneath a sheltering tree, while
Cabanacte watched by her side until his eyes
grew dim and his head would wobble from the
fillips of fatigue. Presently he would shake
slumber from his stooping shoulders and sit erect,
to gaze down lovingly upon the quiet face and
the slender, graceful figure of the melancholy
maiden, whose beauty was more potent to his
eyes than the heavy hand of sleep. Why should
Cabanacte give way to dreams while his gaze
could rest upon a vision of the night more grateful
to his longing soul than the fairest picture
that his fancy had ever drawn?</p>

<p>Now and again the dusky giant would gently
touch the sleeping maiden&#8217;s brow with trembling
fingers, or bend down to press with reverent lips
a kiss upon her cool, smooth cheek. Half-awakened
by his caress, Katonah would stir restlessly
in the arms of mother-earth, and Cabanacte,
alarmed and repentant, would draw himself erect
again to continue his conflict with the promptings
of his love and the call to oblivion with which
sleep assailed him.</p>

<p>Often in the heat of noonday his guard would
be relieved, and he would slumber beneath the
trees while Katonah sat as sentry by his side.
Then would the flying and the climbing and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
crawling creatures of the forest come forth to
sing and chatter and squeak in the effort to lure
the silent, sad-eyed maiden to tell to them the
secret of her heart. Of whom was she thinking
as she reclined against a tree-trunk and gazed, not
at the stalwart, picturesque youth stretched in
sleep upon the greensward at her side, but up at
the white-flecked, May-day sky, a patch of dotted
blue above the flowering trees? Why did the
tears creep into her dark, gentle eyes at such a
time as this? Was she not young and strong and
beautiful? Was not all nature joyous with the
bounding pulse of spring? What craveth this
brown-cheeked maiden which the kindly earth
has not bestowed? Surely, the sleeping stripling
at her feet is worthy of her maiden heart!
Not often does the spring-time lure into the
forest, to meet the searching, knowing eyes of a
thousand living creatures, a nobler youth than he
who, for days and nights, has been her worshipper
and slave. The forest is young to-day with
vernal ecstasy, but, oh, how old it is with the
worldly wisdom of long centuries! What means
this futile wooing of a sun-burnt demigod and
the cold indifference of a stubborn maiden, who
sighs and weeps when all the joys of this glad
earth are hers?</p>

<p>The forest holds a mystery, a problem strange
and new. The breeze at sunset tells the story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
to the blushing waters of the lakes, and spreads
the gossip through the swamps and glades. The
moonbeams steal abroad and verify the tale that
the twilight breeze had voiced. A youth and
maiden, young and beautiful, so runs the chatter
of the woods and streams, wander in sadness along
a zigzag trail, and, while he sighs, the maiden
weeps and moans. There is no precedent, in all
the forest lore, for this strange, futile quest of
misery, this daily search for some new cause for
tears where all the world is singing hymns of joy
and praise.</p>

<p>And all the questions which the forest asked
had found an echo in Cabanacte&#8217;s soul. Why
should Katonah gaze into his loving eyes with
a glance which spoke of sorrow at her heart?
What was there in all this wondrous paradise of
earth which he, a youth of mighty prowess,
could not lay at her dear feet? He would take
her to the City of the Sun and teach her how to
smile in gladness, how to make his home a joy.
Did she fear the slavish drudgery of the women
of her race and his? Oh, Sun in Heaven, could
he but make her understand the broken Spanish
of his clumsy tongue, he&#8217;d swear an oath to toil
for her from year to year, to keep her slender
hands at rest and hold her higher than the wives
whose fate she feared!</p>

<p>Often would Cabanacte take Katonah&#8217;s hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
in his, and, smiling up at her as she leaned against
a tree, strive to make his scraps of Spanish aid
the noble purpose of his heart. Now and then
the knowledge which the girl had gained of
French would serve Cabanacte&#8217;s turn, and she
would smile in comprehension of some word
which he had voiced. After a time she found
herself amused and interested by his earnest
efforts to put her into touch with the ardent, uncomplicated
longings of his simple soul. One
day she had attempted to make answer to his
question&mdash;clarified by the eloquence of primitive
gestures&mdash;whether she would return with him to
the City of the Sun. They had laughed aloud
at the strange linguistic jumble which had ensued,
and the spying gossips of the forest had
sent forth the stirring rumor that the coy maiden
had dried her tears and was at last worthy of
the blessings of the spring. But hardly had the
forest learned the story of Katonah&#8217;s laughter,
when the tears gleamed in her eyes and her
whispered negative drove the smile from Cabanacte&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>From this beginning, however, the youth and
maiden had developed, through the long, aimless
hours of their sylvan wanderings, a curious, amorphous
<i>patois</i>, made up of a few words culled
from the French and Spanish tongues and forced
by Cabanacte to tell an ancient tale in a language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
new to man. It brought renewed hope to the
youth&#8217;s sinking heart to find words which could
drive, if only for a moment, the mournful gleam
from Katonah&#8217;s sad eyes, or, when fate was very
kind, tempt a fleeting smile to her trembling
lips.</p>

<p>But even after they had garnered a few useful
words from Latin roots, there remained a
heavy shadow upon the hearts of Katonah and
her swain. Between them stood an elusive, intangible,
but persistent and domineering, something,
which restrained Cabanacte with its cruel
grip, and often turned Katonah deaf to her
lover&#8217;s passionate words and blind to the adoring
splendor which shone in his burning eyes.
A savage maiden&#8217;s foolish dream, a cherished
memory which haunted her by day and crept
into her sleep at night decreed that Cabanacte
should woo her heart in vain and in a forest
musical with love should grow sick with longing
for the word that she would not speak. With
gentle wiles and all the art his simple nature
knew he laid before Katonah the treasures of
devotion, and, &#8217;though she smiled, and gazed into
his eyes with tender gratitude, she waved them
all aside and sat in silence in the moonlit night,
recalling a pale, clear-cut face upon which she
never hoped to look again.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_238.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;A WHITE-FACED MAN PRESSING TO HIS BREAST A<br />
DARK-HAIRED MAIDEN&#8221;</p>

<p>It was long past midnight, and Cabanacte,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
weary of his vigil, and worn with the melancholy
thoughts which oppressed him, leaned against a
tree and dozed for a time while the maiden, reclining
at his side, listened in her dreams to a
mocking voice which had aforetime been music
to her heart. The murmurs of the night had
died away to silence as the moon fell toward
the west, and the forest had settled itself for a
nap before the dawn should hail the noisy day,
when Katonah and Cabanacte were hurled to
their feet by a crackling crash, which echoed
through the protesting woods with a threatening
insistence that stopped for an instant the beating
of their hearts. Seizing the girl&#8217;s cold hand,
Cabanacte, glancing around him upon all sides
with affrighted eyes, rushed wildly away from
the oak-tree beneath which they had found rest,
and strove, with a giant&#8217;s strength, to win his
way to the great river as a refuge from a wilderness
in which evil spirits menaced them with
ugly cries. Suddenly the stalwart youth paused
in his mad career and drew the panting maiden
close to his side. Far away between the trees a
ghastly creature, a spectral man or monkey,
crept and ran and bounded toward the shadow-haunted
depths of the forest from which they
fled. Knowing all the secrets of the woods, Cabanacte
turned cold at the fleeting vision which
had checked his wild flight, for never had he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
seen beneath the moon so weird a sight. Almost
before he could regain his breath it had
come and gone, and the night was once again
his lonely, silent friend.</p>

<p>Trembling from the cumulative horrors which
had so suddenly beset their ears and eyes, Cabanacte
and Katonah stole through the forest
toward the river, which glimmered now and then
between the trees. The giant&#8217;s arm was thrown
around Katonah&#8217;s slender waist, and Cabanacte
could feel the hurried beating of her aching heart
as he pressed her to his side, as if to defend her
from some new peril lurking in these treacherous
wilds.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they crept apprehensively toward
the outskirts of the trees, the broad expanse of
the Mississippi broke upon their sight, and, between
their coigne of vantage and the river, they
saw a tableau which emphasized their growing
conviction that some strange enchantment was
working wonders on the earth at night, to bind
them together by ties woven in the land of
ghosts.</p>

<p>Before their startled gaze stood a slender,
white-faced man pressing to his breast a dark-haired
maiden clad in black, and as they crouched
beneath the underbrush they saw the brother
of the moon bend down and kiss the spirit of
the sun.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Coyocop!&#8221; muttered Cabanacte, in a
voice of wonder and adoration. &#8220;She has come
to the forest to drive away the evil demons of
the night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; whispered Katonah, urging her lover
by the hand toward the woods from which they
had just escaped&mdash;&#8220;come, Cabanacte! I love
you! Do you understand my words? I love
you, Cabanacte! Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the dusky giant, a willing captive led back
to a joyous prison, followed Katonah toward the
haunted glades, he knew that Coyocop had
wrought a miracle and had banished from the
forest the demons who had warred against his
love.</p>

<small>IN WHICH DE SANCERRE WEEPS AND FIGHTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I have</span> searched in all directions,&#8221; remarked
de Sancerre to Do&ntilde;a Julia, standing upon the
river-bank and watching the early sunbeams as
they greeted the rippling flood, &#8220;and I fear my
captain&#8217;s people did not abandon the canoe whose
contents they left here as a gift from the good
St. Maturin. But we are in good case! &#8217;Tis
a kindly stream, and its bosom will bear us gently
to my friends. The walls of these frail huts
will serve us well to form a raft.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Spanish maiden watched the golden glory
of the dawn, as it made a mirror of the stately
stream, with eyes which glowed with happiness
and peace. The dread of many perils which
beset de Sancerre&#8217;s mind found no reflection in
the devout soul of Julia de Aquilar. Had not
the saints wrought miracles to lead her from
captivity? Weak, indeed, would be her faith if
she doubted the kind persistence of their aid.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis but repaying what I owe, se&ntilde;ora, if I
should make you safe at last,&#8221; continued de Sancerre,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
musingly, taking Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s hand in his.
&#8220;You saved my life. You have not told me how
you knew they&#8217;d dressed my fish with poison
from the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, monsieur,&#8221; sighed the girl, regretting
that he had recalled the sorrows and dangers of
the past, which seemed to her at this glad hour
like the unreal horrors of a nightmare forever
ended. &#8220;You must remember that I&#8217;ve spent
a long, sad year in that City of the Sun. I&#8217;m
quick to learn an alien tongue, and, without effort,
I came to understand the language of the
priests. The saints be praised, I&#8217;ll know no more
of it! And so I heard them plotting in the
night outside my door to give you poison in the
fish you ate. I prayed to Mother Mary to find
a way&mdash;and, lo! my prayer was answered, for
Noco came to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, how much we owe to Noco!&#8221; exclaimed
de Sancerre, scanning the river and the forest with
searching eyes, as he turned to lead Do&ntilde;a Julia
to the hut in which, through the aid of their
aged companion, they were to break their fast.
By means of the flintlock on his gun de Sancerre
had kindled a fire, at which Noco had been
cooking cakes of corn-meal, the odor from which
now mingled with the bracing fragrance of the
cool May morning.</p>

<p>As they entered the hut the girl uttered a cry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
of dismay, and de Sancerre strode quickly to the
prostrate form of their faithful counsellor and
guide. Stretched before a snapping fire of twigs,
with her last earthly task undone, lay Noco, dead,
the grin and wrinkles smoothed from her old,
brown face by the kindly hand of eternal sleep.
The strain of the night&#8217;s wild race had been too
great for her brave heart, and, when called upon
by the labor of the day, it had ceased to beat.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia threw herself upon her knees beside
the only friend she had known in her long
captivity, and, with sobs and prayers, gave vent
to the sorrow in her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> I think I loved that queer
old hag!&#8221; murmured de Sancerre to himself,
brushing a tear from his pale cheek, as he turned
toward the wood-fire to resume the work from
which Noco had been called by death. &#8220;I thought
there was no limit to the vigor in her frame!
Alas for her, I set the pace too hot!&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was no time for sighs and vain regrets.
De Sancerre knew the woods too well to
let his fire long toss the smoke between the fissures
of the hut. Removing the corn-cakes from
the blaze, he extinguished the flames at once, and
urged Do&ntilde;a Julia to eat freely of a simple meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; pleaded de Sancerre,
earnestly, seeing that the sudden taking-off of
their aged comrade had robbed the sorrowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
girl of all desire for food&mdash;&#8220;remember that the
larder of our raft will be a crude affair. I know
not when the luxury of corn-cakes will tempt our
teeth again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia smiled sadly and renewed her efforts
to do justice to a repast for which she had
no heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think not, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; she said, in Spanish, gazing
at de Sancerre with eyes bright with pride
and fortitude, &#8220;that I have learned no lessons
from a year of peril and dismay. You knew me
in the luxury of courts. Methinks you&#8217;ll find
me changed in many ways. I mourn old Noco.
She saved me from despair. She hated Spaniards,
but she worshipped me. Ah, se&ntilde;or, she
had a loyal heart. May the saints be kind to
her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amen!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre, fervently.
&#8220;And now, se&ntilde;ora, we have no time to lose!
Untie the meal-bags in the corner there and bring
the cords to me. I&#8217;ll pull a hut to pieces and
make a raft of logs upon the shore. For every
mile the river puts between this spot and us, I&#8217;ll
vow a candle to St. Maturin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fastening a powder-horn and a bullet-pouch to
his waist, to the deep resentment of his patrician
rapier, de Sancerre, with gun in hand, hurried to
the river-bank and chose a convenient spot from
which to launch his treacherous craft upon a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
kindly current flowing toward the camp of
friends. As the hours passed by and his raft
grew in size and strength, the depression which
the death of Noco had cast upon de Sancerre&#8217;s
spirits stole away, and there were hope and cheer
in the smiles with which he greeted Do&ntilde;a Julia
when she came to him now and again from the
hut with stout cords with which he spliced together
the clumsy, stubborn logs of his rude boat.
At short intervals he would abandon his task as
a raft-builder to scan, with straining eyes, the
broad expanse of river upon his left, or to listen
breathlessly for sounds of menacing import in
the forest at his back. But the sun had reached
the zenith, his raft was nearly built, and de Sancerre
could discover, neither upon flood nor land,
aught to suggest that man-hunting man was stirring
at high noon.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Courage</i>, mademoiselle,&#8221; he cried, gayly, in
his native tongue, as Do&ntilde;a Julia, pale and silent,
approached him from the hut. &#8220;Another hour
will find us voyageurs at last. We&#8217;ll name our
gallant little ship <i>La Coyocop</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The saints forefend!&#8221; exclaimed the girl,
smiling at his fancy. &#8220;&#8217;Twould bring disaster
with it! &#8217;Tis a heathen name! We&#8217;ll christen
our good raft in honor of the Virgin or the
saints. They have been kind to us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, you speak the truth, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>! My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
patron saint, the kindly Maturin, has saved me
from all blunders for a day. If ever I should see
a godly land again, I&#8217;ll raise an altar to his
memory.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mocking undertone in de Sancerre&#8217;s light,
laughing voice recalled to Do&ntilde;a Julia the old
days at Versailles when this same man, who, by
a marvel wrought in Paradise, now stood beside
her in a wilderness, had touched upon many things
which she had held in high regard with the irreverent
wit of a flippant tongue. But, on the
instant, she felt that she had been unjust to de
Sancerre in taking, even for a moment, the path
along which memory led. The earnest, courageous,
resourceful man at her side was not the
debonair, satirical cavalier whom she had known
at court. She had said to him that he would find
a change in her, wrought by a year of danger and
despair. She realized, through the quick intuitions
of a loving heart, that during that same
lapse of time the wild, stirring life which he had
led had touched the nobler chords in the soul of
de Sancerre, and had brought to view a manly
earnestness and force which had stamped his mobile
face with an imprint grateful to her eyes.
At Versailles the courtier had fascinated her
against her will. In the wilderness the man
had won the unforced homage of her admiration.
If, now and then, his tongue, by habit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
used flippant words to speak of mighty mysteries,
the saints in heaven would forgive him this,
for he had grown to be a man well worthy of
their tender care.</p>

<p>The truth of this came to Do&ntilde;a Julia with renewed
insistence as she and de Sancerre, having
made the final preparations for their embarkation,
knelt beside old Noco&#8217;s corpse and, hand
clasping hand, voiced a prayer for the repose of
their faithful ally&#8217;s soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not wait to give her burial,&#8221; said de
Sancerre, regretfully, as he and the girl left the
hut, carrying to their raft what little corn-meal
and gunpowder their frail craft allowed to them
as cargo. &#8220;But well I know the saints will treat
her well. Her claim upon them is the same as
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia glanced up at de Sancerre, questioningly.
He looked into her dark, earnest eyes
with his heart in his, and answered her in Spanish:</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Noco worshipped you, se&ntilde;ora&mdash;as I do!
<i>Caramba!</i> What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Frenchman stood motionless for a moment
watching an object which broke the monotony
of the river&#8217;s broad expanse on their left.
Presently he placed the keg of gunpowder, which
he had been carrying, upon the shore, and, seizing
the long, clumsy musket at his feet, examined the
pan and hammer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>&#8220;What is it, se&ntilde;or?&#8221; asked the girl, calmly,
glancing up the river at a bobbing, white speck
far to the northward, and then looking into de
Sancerre&#8217;s pale, set face with eyes in which no
terror gleamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know, se&ntilde;ora!&#8221; exclaimed the Frenchman.
&#8220;But I fancy &#8217;tis a thing which has no
hold upon the saints!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think it is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear it is a war-canoe of white-robed devils,
whose only claim to mercy is that they knew you
were from God. But listen, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>. They
must not see you here! There is no safety for
us within the woods, for they would find my
raft and track us quickly to the trees. The
weird moon-magic of this snaphance gun must
turn them from their course. Go back into the
hut, and let their black eyes search for you in
vain. With good St. Maturin&#8217;s most timely gift
I&#8217;ll show them that a bullet is harder than their
hearts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, no&mdash;I cannot leave you now!&#8221; exclaimed
the girl, shuddering at the prospect of a lonely
vigil in the room where Noco lay.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no place for you, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; said de Sancerre,
grimly, glancing again at the river, down
which a large canoe, manned by ten stalwart
sun-worshippers, which rose and fell upon the
favoring tide, was approaching them with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
menace of death for de Sancerre and captivity
for the girl. &#8220;Go to the hut at once! I shall not
keep you waiting long. If the magic of my musket
should not avail, we&#8217;ll test the friendliness of
yonder trees. But, still, I think my merry gun
will drive the cowards back.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later de Sancerre, humming snatches
of the love-song which he had sung before the
cabin of the goddess Coyocop, fingered his musket
with impatience as he waited for the war-canoe
to swing within easy range of a weapon
with which he had had no long experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Nom de Dieu!</i>&#8221; he muttered, as he raised
the gun to his shoulder and then lowered it
again to await a more favorable opportunity for
his initial shot. &#8220;They make a gallant show!
Their sun-baked brawn and muscle form a target
which would rejoice the heart of a <i>coureur
de bois</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that instant a cry of mingled rage and triumph
arose from the paddlers as they discovered
the picturesque figure, standing erect upon
the bank in tattered velvets and toying with a
curiously-shaped implement which had no terrors
for their unsophisticated eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, I think the time is ripe to do my little
trick!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre, gayly, a smile
of derision playing across his thin lips as the echo
of his pursuers&#8217; shout of delight and anger came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
back to him from the wall of forest trees. &#8220;My
hand is steady, and my heart is light! You
black-haired devil, drop that paddle!&#8221;</p>

<p>The mimic lightning made by flint and steel
changed powder into noise, and as the river and
the trees tossed back and forth the echoes of the
musket&#8217;s roar, a dusky athlete, dropping his paddle
with a moan, toppled over dead into the
shimmer of the sun-kissed waves.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bien, ma petite!</i>&#8221; cried de Sancerre, patting
his smoking gun with grateful hand. &#8220;The
magic of the moon is working well to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the horrified sun-worshippers
lost control of their canoe, and it drifted jerkily
toward the centre of the stream. Presently,
recovering their wits, they plunged their paddles
into the flood and held their responsive, graceful
boat steadfast on the waves, seemingly in doubt
as to the course they should pursue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound them!&#8221; muttered the Frenchman,
who had leisurely recharged his musket. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
strange how slow these bright-eyed devils are to
learn! Do they want ten miracles, when one
should well suffice? They seem to crave another
message from the moon. If I could hit a moving
boat-load, I&#8217;ll have no trouble now! They&#8217;re
steadying my target&mdash;to the greater glory of my
magic gun! Adieu&mdash;once more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the peaceful day protested loudly against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
de Sancerre&#8217;s noisy tricks, and the waters gained
another victim from the worshippers of fire.
There was no further hesitation aboard the great
canoe. With paddles wielded by hands cold with
fear, and arms bursting with the struggle to drive
their boat beyond the fatal circle of a demon&#8217;s
witchery, the sun-worshippers frantically urged
their primitive war-ship upward against the current
of this treacherous river of death. Laying
his faithful gun upon the bank, de Sancerre
watched his retreating foes for a happy moment.
Removing his torn bonnet with a flourish from
his throbbing head, he made a stately bow, unheeded
by the terrified canoemen, and cried
gayly:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Adieu, messieurs!</i> They&#8217;ll hear of you in
France anon! And then beware! Adieu!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a light heart and feet which seemed to
spurn the sloping bank, de Sancerre rushed toward
the hut in which the woman of his love had
been listening in terror to the scolding of his
gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Behold me, mademoiselle,&#8221; he cried, jubilantly,
as he drew the trembling girl to his breast,
&#8220;a musketeer who wastes no powder upon his
foes! I kiss your lips, my life and love! The
prayers you sent to Heaven, I well know, have
saved our lives again! Another kiss&mdash;and so we
will embark.&#8221;</p>

<small>IN WHICH DO&Ntilde;A JULIA IS REMINDED OF THE PAST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was night; black, oppressively damp, with
thunder in the air and fitful lightning zigzagging
across the sulky sky. With deep sighs, the
forest prepared for the chastisement of the
threatening storm. A sound like the sobbing of
great trees followed the distant grumbling of
dark, menacing clouds. The flying, climbing,
crawling creatures of the woods and swamps
and river-banks had heeded the warnings of the
hour and had stolen to shelter from the wrath of
the fickle spring-time.</p>

<p>The majestic Mississippi, swollen with the
pride of power, flowed downward in silence
through the gloom to throw its mighty arms
around the islands near the gulf. Now and
again its broad expanse would reflect for an
instant the lightning&#8217;s glare and then grow
blacker than before, as if it repented of its recognition
of the storm. Presently great drops
of water pelted the bosom of the stream,
and far to the westward the forest cried out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
against the sudden impact of the resounding
rain.</p>

<p>For many hours de Sancerre had been guiding
his raft with an improvised paddle, the blade of
which he had made from the wood of a powderkeg,
and the long afternoon, when it had run its
course, had left the adventurers nearer to the
gulf by many weary miles than they had been
at embarkation. Worthy of the trust which the
dauntless Frenchman had placed in it, the hospitable
stream had gently carried de Sancerre&#8217;s
raft down the watery pathway along which
Sieur de la Salle had found the road to disaster
and immortality.</p>

<p>An hour before sunset, however, misfortune,
in defiance of the saintly name which Do&ntilde;a
Julia had bestowed upon their primitive vessel,
had overtaken the fugitives. Several logs, disaffected
through the treachery of rotten cord,
had broken away from the sides. Fearing the
complete disintegration of his raft, de Sancerre
had, with some difficulty, succeeded in making a
landing and in removing his precious gun and
stores to the shelter of the underbrush. He had
hardly completed his task, and drawn his unreliable
craft up to a safe mooring upon the shore,
when the unwelcome storm had begun to fulfil
its threats.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear,&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre, drawing Do&ntilde;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
Julia close to his side, as they strove to shelter
themselves from the rain beneath the overhanging
bushes on the river-bank&mdash;&#8220;I fear our supper
will be cold and wet to-night. I now begin to
understand just why those white-robed children
of the sun should worship fire. You tremble,
<i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>. Tell me, are you cold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; exclaimed Do&ntilde;a Julia, her face
close to his to defeat the uproar of the rain.
&#8220;The storm will pass. Ah, se&ntilde;or, what cause
we have for gratitude!&#8221;</p>

<p>Somewhere in the forest at their backs the
lightning struck a tree and their eyes rested for
an instant upon a river made of flames, which a
crash of angry thunder extinguished at their
birth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother Mary, save us!&#8221; exclaimed the girl,
while the hand which de Sancerre held trembled
for an instant in his grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst has passed, sweetheart,&#8221; he murmured,
reassuringly, bending down until his lips
touched hers. &#8220;Listen! The rain falls lighter
upon the leaves above us now. These sudden
storms in southern lands are like the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Si, se&ntilde;or?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like the anger of a Spaniard, I had said,&#8221;
confessed de Sancerre.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mayhap,&#8221; murmured the girl, her eyes meeting
his despite the blackness of the gloom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
&#8220;And think you, sir, they&#8217;re like a Spaniard&#8217;s
love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, how can I tell?&#8221; he cried, laughingly.
&#8220;You, se&ntilde;ora, must guide me to the truth.
But listen!&#8221; he went on, his voice growing earnest,
as, forgetful for the moment of the storm
and perils of the night, he gazed down upon the
upturned face of a maiden who had shown to
him the unsuspected depths of his own heart,
&#8220;if your love for me is but a passing fancy, born
of solitude and taught to speak by chance, I
beg of you to pray the saints that I may die to-night.
To live to lose your love&mdash; I&#8217;d choose
a thousand deaths instead!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the girl&#8217;s dark eyes de Sancerre could see a
protest growing as he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; she murmured, turning her
gaze from his to watch the distant lightning as
it flashed across the waters from the black clouds
which covered the storm&#8217;s retreat. &#8220;My life
has been so strange I fear I may not speak as
other maidens would. But why should I not
confess the truth? My love for you is not a
forest growth. The saints forgive me, I loved
you at Versailles! If in this awful wilderness
you&#8217;re dearer to my heart than when, at court,
you hurt my pride and showed my heart itself,
&#8217;tis not my fickleness which is at fault. I&#8217;ve
loved none other, se&ntilde;or, in my life.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>&#8220;You were betrothed!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre,
impulsively, a man rather than a courtier at the
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a story for another hour than this,&#8221; said
Do&ntilde;a Julia, softly. &#8220;Don Josef! Mother Mary
be good to him! I always hated him, se&ntilde;or&mdash;although
my hand was his. But look how the
moon breaks through above those clouds! The
storm is over, and the night grows clear. Shall
we launch our raft again? I fear the forest,
se&ntilde;or, more than yonder stream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I dare not float at night, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>&#8221; answered
de Sancerre, smoothing the raven hair
from her white forehead as her head rested upon
his shoulder, and they watched the fickle night
change its garb of black, fringed with fire, for
the silvery costume vouchsafed by the full moon.
&#8220;I fear I might steal past my captain in the
dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly he pressed her face, splendid in its
beauty as the moon caressed it, to his breast,
while he gazed across his shoulder at the dripping
forest with eyes large with sudden fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;God in heaven! There it comes again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Against his will, the words forced themselves
from de Sancerre&#8217;s parched lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, se&ntilde;or?&#8221; whispered Do&ntilde;a Julia,
trembling at the horror in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;A white, misshapen thing,&#8221; he muttered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
hoarsely. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen it once before. It lies upon
the ground beneath a tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>They neither moved nor spoke for a long
moment. De Sancerre strove in vain to rouse
the mocking sceptic in his mind. Son of a
superstitious age, he could not conquer the idea
that he was haunted in the wilds by the lover of
this girl, whom he had slain. Presently, as he
still watched the white blotch beneath the weeping
tree, his will regained its strength and he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit here, se&ntilde;ora. I&#8217;ll go to it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, and, on the instant, Do&ntilde;a
Julia stood by his side, while her gaze followed
his toward the spectral outlines of an out-stretched
man, motionless and ghastly beneath the moon.</p>

<p>&#8220;The saints protect us! You shall not go
alone!&#8221; exclaimed the girl, putting an icy hand
into de Sancerre&#8217;s grasp and taking a firm step
toward the mystery which tested the courage of
her soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not come with me, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; cried
de Sancerre, budging not an inch. &#8220;From where
you stand your eyes can follow me. I shall return
at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Releasing her hand, the Frenchman sprang
forward, and in another moment stood gazing
down at the almost naked body of a man whose
soul at that very instant had passed from this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
world to the next. In death the thin, drawn face
regained the lines of youth, but on the head the
hair was white, and on his chin a tuft of beard
gleamed like silver in the moonlight. There was
no flesh upon his bones. The night wind stirred
the rags still clinging to his frame and tossed an
oil-skin bag, fastened by a string around his neck,
across his chest. A crucifix in miniature rested at
that instant just above his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Nom de Dieu</i>, it is a Spaniard&mdash;but not the
ghost of him I slew!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre,
breaking away from the horrid spectacle to return
to Do&ntilde;a Julia. He had no need to go, for the
girl was at his side, gazing down at the corpse
with horror-stricken eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Juan Rodriquez!&#8221; she exclaimed, in a
tone which voiced a conflict of emotions. &#8220;He
goes to God with black, foul crimes upon his
soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was this man, se&ntilde;ora?&#8221; asked de Sancerre
in amazement, drawing the girl to one side
out of the insistent glare from the shrivelled
corpse.</p>

<p>&#8220;An evil, treacherous creature, se&ntilde;or, who
served my father as a scribe. I thought that he
had perished with the others in the ship. I spoke
his name to-day, when I told you the story of
my father&#8217;s awful fate. From the moment of
my father&#8217;s fall, until I found myself within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
City of the Sun, my memory is dumb. That was
a year ago and more. The man who&#8217;s lying
there has suffered torments, se&ntilde;or, before his
time was ripe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d lost his reason and become a beast,&#8221;
exclaimed de Sancerre, shortly. &#8220;But still he
was from Europe, and has a claim upon us! I&#8217;ll
get my paddle and scratch a hole to hide him
from the wolves. And then I&#8217;ll say a prayer,
and let him rest in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a murderer!&#8221; gasped the girl, trembling
with cold as the rising breeze forced her
damp garments against her weary limbs.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, if that is so, our prayers are little
worth. But come, <i>ch&eacute;rie</i>, there is less wind beneath
this hill. I will return and throw some
earth above those bones. If that white fragment
of a wicked man had murdered all my kin, I
would not leave him there uncovered for all time.
He came from lands we know&mdash;and so I&#8217;ll treat
him well! God, how I shall welcome the sight
of de la Salle!&#8221;</p>

<p>With quick sympathy the girl put her hand
upon de Sancerre&#8217;s arm as they turned their
faces toward the glimmering flood.</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman is so useless, se&ntilde;or!&#8221; she exclaimed,
&#8220;I can do naught but pray! But show me how
I best may aid you now. I will try so hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know not what you say, se&ntilde;ora!&#8221; cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
de Sancerre in Spanish, clasping the cold hand
resting upon his arm as he led her toward the
river. &#8220;Useless, quotha? Is a woman useless
who teaches a wayward, rebellious, mocking
heart the peace and glory of true love? I say
to you, my Julia, that as Mother Mary is greater
than the saints, so is a good woman better than
the best of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he added, smiling gayly as his happy
eyes met her earnest gaze, and changing his
tongue to French: &#8220;Not, <i>ch&eacute;rie</i>, that I am the
best of men!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are to me! Is not that enough?&#8221; she
murmured, in a tone which made sweet music to
his ears.</p>

<p>A half an hour had passed and de Sancerre
had returned to the girl from his grewsome task
as a grave-digger. The awful fate of the murderer
to whom he had given hasty burial depressed
his spirits, for the dead man had borne upon
his emaciated frame the marks of his long year
of misery, a year during which he had wandered
through the wilds in a great circle, until hunger
and exposure had made him a mad, crawling
animal, too long despised by death itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were papers in this oil-skin bag,&#8221; remarked
de Sancerre, throwing himself wearily
upon the bank beside Do&ntilde;a Julia. &#8220;As he was
secretary to your father, I thought it best to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
examine what he had kept so safe upon his breast.
It was not wrong, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s face was even paler than its wont
was, as she met her lover&#8217;s questioning eyes.
Her lips trembled slightly as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;He boasted once, upon our vessel&#8217;s deck, that
he&#8217;d be master when we reached New Spain.
Our king had granted lands and silver mines in
Mexico to my dear father, rewarding him for his
success in France. &#8217;Tis possible&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>An exclamation uttered by de Sancerre interrupted
Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s surmise. The Frenchman
had been examining two imposing parchments
by the clear light of the full moon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;s scribe, se&ntilde;ora, was a man of fertile
mind. King Charles of Spain has made two
grants covering the same ground, one to his &#8216;dear,
beloved son in Christ, Don Rodrigo de Aquilar,&#8217;
and the other to his &#8216;dear, beloved son in Christ,
Don Juan Rodriquez.&#8217; &#8217;Tis clear enough that
one of these is forged, but, for my life, I could
not pick the honest parchment from the false.
Why yonder villain kept them both, I do not
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I know,&#8221; mused the girl, in a weary
voice. &#8220;He thought less of robbery than how
to make me his. He would have torn this skilful
counterfeit into a thousand bits had I been
kind to him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>&#8220;<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> He dared to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia glanced chidingly at the impetuous
Frenchman.</p>

<p>&#8220;You spoke not harshly of him when I told
you of his awful crimes,&#8221; she said, while her
hand crept shyly into de Sancerre&#8217;s. &#8220;Is he less
worthy of your leniency because he schemed to
win the hand you hold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis selfishness, I know,&#8221; said de Sancerre,
thoughtfully, gazing contentedly into the dark
eyes which met his. &#8220;I cared but little that
he&#8217;d killed some man I never knew, but if he
loved you, se&ntilde;ora, I&#8217;m glad he died the death!&#8221;
Seizing the forged parchment upon his lap, the
Frenchman tore it to pieces and scattered the
fragments upon the ground. Then he replaced
the genuine grant in the oil-skin bag and fastened
it to his sword-belt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must repair my raft, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>,&#8221; he said to
the girl a moment later, bending down to kiss
her cheek, cold and smooth and white. &#8220;You
will forgive me, sweetheart, for loving you so
well?&#8221;</p>

<p>Not far away the moonlight, falling in soft
radiance between the trees, had thrown upon a
rough grave, newly-made, the shadow of a cross.</p>

<small>IN WHICH ST. EUSTACE IS KIND TO DE SANCERRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Overlooking</span> the waters of the great river, as
they met and mingled with the waves of a lonely
sea, stood a wooden column beside a wooden
cross. Almost hidden by the shadow of the
pompous pillar, the cross, unmarked by hand of
man, made no open claim to power, but awaited
patiently the outcome of the years. Upon the
column had been inscribed the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Louis le Grand, Roy de France et de Navarre, r&egrave;gne; le
Neuvi&egrave;me Avril, 1682.</p>
</div>

<p>Now and then the King&#8217;s Column would appear
to hold converse with the Cross of Christ,
for it was a weary vigil which they kept, and the
lofty pillar, haughtily displaying the arms of
France, was forced, from very loneliness, to
recognize the humble emblem at its base.</p>

<p>Through long, sunny days and soft, moonlit
nights the salt breeze from the sea heard the
royal column boasting to the lowly cross. By
virtue of the legend upon its breast, said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
King&#8217;s Pillar, a great monarch had gained a
vast domain. Savannas, forests, prairies, deserts,
rivers, lakes, and mountains, forming a gigantic
province, had become, through a word uttered
by a great explorer, the property of him whose
name the wooden column bore. Through all the
oncoming ages, the King&#8217;s Pillar asserted, Louis
le Grand, Roy de France et de Navarre, and his
posterity, would own the fair lands through
which a mighty river and its tributaries flowed.
It was not to be wondered at that the stately
column grew vain with the grandeur of its
mission upon earth, and even garrulous at times,
as it described to the insignificant cross the
splendor of the dreams which a glowing future
vouchsafed to it.</p>

<p>The Cross of Christ would listen in silence to
the mouthing of the Royal Claimant, gazing
further into the future, with a clearer vision
than the proud pillar, whose words were those
of men blinded by the intoxication of transient
power. The unpretentious cross could well afford
to indulge in the luxury of silence. Since it had
first become a symbol of the power which is begotten
by the teachings of humility and love, it
had heard, a thousand times, the boastful words
of monarchs swollen with the glory of ephemeral
success. It had seen emperors and kings seizing
lands and peoples to hold them in subjection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
until time should be no more. But the centuries
had come and gone, and the banners of earthly
kings, rising and falling, had pressed onward
and been driven back. Only the cross, emblem
of peace on earth and good will to men, had,
through those same ages, steadily enlarged the
dominion over which its gentle rule prevailed.
Carried forward often by fanatics and made to
serve the ends of cruel hearts, it was, in spite of
all the errors of its followers, slowly but surely
receiving the earth for its heritage and mankind
as the reward of its benignity.</p>

<p>One afternoon, late in the month of May, a
man, pale, dejected, moving with the heavy step
of one who had undergone great bodily fatigue,
led a maiden, upon whose white face lay the
shadow of a weariness against which youth could
not prevail, toward the King&#8217;s Column. Removing
his bonnet from a head grown gray
from recent hardships, the man, releasing the
girl&#8217;s hand, bent a knee before the proud emblem
of his sovereign. At the same moment
the maiden knelt down before the cross, and,
weeping softly, breathed a prayer to a Mother
whose Son had died for men.</p>

<p>Presently the girl arose and, followed by him
who had paid his tribute to the fleeting power
of kings, skirted the royal column, and seated
herself upon a mound of sand from which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
could sweep, with her dark, mournful eyes, the
expanse of a gulf new to the keel of ships.
Stretching before her as if it knew no bounds
lay a great water, an awful waste of sun-kissed,
dancing waves, whose glittering splendor brought
no solace to her heavy heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a mystery which I cannot fathom,&#8221; said
de Sancerre, mournfully, throwing himself down
by Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s side and gazing up at her sad,
sweet face with eyes heavy from a disappointment
which had crushed, for the time being, the
fond hopes which had inspired him through long
days of labor and nights of wakeful vigilance.
&#8220;The good faith of the stern, upright de la Salle
I cannot doubt. He would jeopardize his life,
and all his mighty projects, to rescue a comrade
to whom his word was pledged. We must have
passed him somewhere in the twilight of the dawn
or when I used the sunset&#8217;s glow too long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What seemeth best to do, se&ntilde;or?&#8221; asked the
girl, turning her gaze from the cruel sea to look
into the face of a man upon whose courage and
resourcefulness she had good reason to rely.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, I hardly know,&#8221; muttered the Frenchman,
looking about him upon the scattered remnants
of de la Salle&#8217;s encampment. &#8220;My captain
may return&mdash;but &#8217;twill be a weary while ere
he comes back. A year, at least, must pass before
he reaches here again. We stand in no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
great danger from starvation, but &#8217;tis a lonely
shore. I thought to lead you from captivity,
and, lo! I&#8217;ve merely changed your cabin-prison
to a sandy jail! I fear St. Maturin has turned
his face from me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be not cast down, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; whispered Do&ntilde;a
Julia, in her native tongue. &#8220;It cannot be that
Mother Mary, who has been most kind to us,
will leave us here to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould be unreasonable,&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre,
almost petulantly. Then he went on, making
an effort at cheerfulness. &#8220;But, for the present,
we have no cause to lose all hope. This
desert shore seems safe from savage men. My
musket there will gain us meat enough, and in
the forest there are fruits and berries fit for royal
boards. In sooth, &#8216;le Roy de France et de Navarre&#8217;
has won a kingdom rich in all good
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re safe from savage men, you say, se&ntilde;or,&#8221;
remarked Do&ntilde;a Julia, musingly, casting a meaning
glance behind her at the silent woods. &#8220;I
fear you do not understand the nation which we
have defied.&#8221; She smiled sadly as she went on:
&#8220;You have abducted Coyocop, a goddess sent
from heaven to make their people great. Although
your musket filled them with dismay,
they&#8217;ll follow us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lines of care upon de Sancerre&#8217;s drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
face grew deeper as he listened thoughtfully to
the girl&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve left no trail,&#8221; he mused, gazing longingly
at the horizon where the sea-line met
the sky. &#8220;They&#8217;re keen as woodsmen, but the
river tells no tales. But, mayhap, you are right!
You&#8217;ve known them long and heard the sun-priests
talk. And if the worst should come, <i>ma
ch&egrave;re</i>, I&#8217;d die for you with sword and gun in
hand beneath the blazoned arms of France.
&#8217;Twould be a fitting ending for a count of
Languedoc.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak not so sadly, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; exclaimed Do&ntilde;a
Julia, placing a gentle hand upon his shoulder
and looking into his face with courageous, hopeful
eyes. &#8220;I sought not to dishearten you, but
&#8217;tis well for you to know the truth. To linger
where we are is far from safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be so,&#8221; admitted de Sancerre, reflectively,
as he examined the lock of his musket
and then stood erect to cast a searching glance
across sea and land. The restless billows of the
gulf, the marshy coast, the islands at the river&#8217;s
mouth, and the grim forest overlooking the
waters, formed a picture which human gaze had
seldom swept. At this moment the outlook held
no menace to the eyes or ears of de Sancerre.
&#8220;To linger where we are, se&ntilde;ora, may not be
safe,&#8221; he remarked, as he reseated himself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
took her hand in his, &#8220;but where &#8217;tis best to go
I hardly know. Our raft will not float up-stream,
and we cannot put to sea. We have not much
to choose! Between this hillock and the next
there can be no great difference in the perils
which surround us. And, somehow, se&ntilde;ora, I
feel nearer to my captain with the arms of
France above my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia pressed de Sancerre&#8217;s hand and her
quick sympathy shone in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your captain, se&ntilde;or&mdash;you loved him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;De la Salle? I know not that I loved him.
But I would have followed him to hell! There
is a grandeur in my captain&#8217;s soul which draws
to him the little men and makes them great.
Aye, se&ntilde;ora, by all succeeding ages the name of
him who raised this wooden column, against
which we lean, in honor must be held! The
deeds of de la Salle shall live, when the feats of
countless noisy boasters are forgotten. But, that
I loved this mighty leader I cannot say. I&#8217;ve
served in Europe under lesser men than de la
Salle, who led me by the heart; while he, methinks,
appeals but to my head. He rules us not
with velvet, but with steel, this dauntless captain,
upon whose martial figure I would that I
might gaze. And that is best, in such a land as
this! Followed by redmen and wild border outlaws,
he could not hold them should he smile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
and scrape. And, at the best, he cannot trust
his men. They grumble at their captain, because
he has no weakness in their eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre&#8217;s long speech, to which Do&ntilde;a Julia
had listened with forced attention, had changed
the melancholy current of his thoughts and restored
the lines of firmness to his mouth, the
light of courage to his eyes. The memory of
the bold adventurer under whom he had served
for many months, and the inspiring legend which
he had read and reread upon the column at his
back, had revived the martial spirit in his impressionable
soul, and his face and voice no longer
bore evidence of the bitter disappointment which
had driven him to the verge of despair when he
had made the discovery that Sieur de la Salle
had abandoned his camp at the Mississippi&#8217;s
mouth. With gun in hand, the Frenchman stood
erect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>, for I crave your counsel
and advice,&#8221; he said, gazing down at Do&ntilde;a Julia.
&#8220;We may be here for months before we find a
means of rescue, either by land or sea. We&#8217;re
worn with sleeplessness and toil, but, more than
this, our bodies crave strong food. We&#8217;ve eaten
meal and berries until I dream of Vatel when I
doze&mdash;great Cond&eacute;&#8217;s cook, who killed himself
because a dish was spoiled. My gun could add
a fat wild turkey to our larder; but the point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
is this: the musket&#8217;s noise might lead our dusky
enemies to seek us here. I feared not their persistence
&#8217;til you spoke of it. This column and
the arms it bears would make no great impression
upon our foes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our only hope must lie in yonder cross,&#8221; murmured
Do&ntilde;a Julia, devoutly. Then she gazed
upward at the thin, white face of a man who
might well call himself at this moment &#8220;a splinter
from a moonbeam,&#8221; so thin and white he
looked. The horror of her situation, should her
brave protector fall sick from lack of nourishing
food, forced itself impressively upon her
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill do no harm, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;for
you to snap your gun. In any case, our enemies,
if they are still upon our track, would find us
here, and if they hear your musket&#8217;s loud report,
&#8217;twill check them for a time. They&#8217;ll think the
woods are haunted with demons threatening
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, they would be, had I the magic which
I claim!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre, examining carefully
the priming of his gun. &#8220;I think, se&ntilde;ora,
that what you say is true. If those brown devils
are now upon our trail, our silence cannot save
us. St. Eustace be my guide! We&#8217;ll break our
fast at sunset, sweetheart, upon a bit of meat.
I&#8217;ll not go out of sight. I&#8217;ve wasted too much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
time, for we must choose a lodging for the night
before the dark has come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reinvigorated in mind and body, de Sancerre
descended the hillock from which the King&#8217;s Column
and the Cross of Christ looked down upon
an empire over which the reign of the proud
pillar was not destined to endure. With eyes
raised to heaven, Do&ntilde;a Julia knelt before the
humble emblem of her faith, and besought the
saints to guard her champion from the perils
which might at this moment beset his steps.
Then she arose, and, leaning against the wooden
monument, watched, with ever-growing interest,
the versatile Frenchman&#8217;s efforts to satisfy his
craving for a more nourishing diet than his labors
as a raftsman had permitted him to gain.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Peste!</i>&#8221; muttered de Sancerre, as he made
his way through the long grass toward the
forest trees, &#8220;this musket is heavier by many
pounds than when the good St. Maturin turned
my footsteps toward it. Unless your bullet, <i>ma
petite</i>, should find its way to yonder sleek, but
most unsuspicious, banquet, I fear you&#8217;ll grow
too weighty for my hands. <i>Laude et jubilate!</i>
The bird is mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre turned and waved his ragged bonnet
toward Do&ntilde;a Julia, who had witnessed the
success of his shot, and then, leisurely reloading
his musket, made his way toward the precious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
trophy of his marksmanship. Suddenly he stood
stock-still, his head thrown back, and his eyes
staring at the forest in amazement. As if in
answer to his gun&#8217;s report, there came from the
distant trees the echo of a musket-shot, which
thrilled the soul of the startled Frenchman with
mingled hope and fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;St. Maturin help me!&#8221; he exclaimed, in a voice
suggesting a parched throat. &#8220;Is it friend or
foe? I thought, <i>ma petite</i>, that you had no kinsman
within the radius of many miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Striving by gestures to urge Do&ntilde;a Julia to
conceal herself behind the King&#8217;s Column, de
Sancerre, with his musket at his shoulder, stretched
himself at full length upon the grass, and,
while his heart beat with suffocating rapidity,
watched with straining eyes a grove of leafy
trees from which the ominous reply to his gun
had been made. Suddenly in front of him, almost
within a stone&#8217;s-throw, stood a tall, slender
man, clad in the unseasonable costume of a
Canadian <i>courier de bois</i>. He carried a smoking
musket in his hand. At his belt dangled a
hatchet, a bullet-pouch, and a bag of tobacco.
In a leather case at his neck hung his only permanent
friend, his pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;St. Maturin be praised!&#8221; cried de Sancerre,
springing to his feet and raising his musket
to arm&#8217;s-length above his head. &#8220;&#8217;Tis that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
rebellious rascal, Jacques Barbier! <i>Bienvenue</i>,
Jacques! In the name of all the saints at once,
how came you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gar!&#8221; exclaimed the lawless runner-of-the-woods,
throwing himself at full length upon the
grass, and gazing up at de Sancerre with a smile,
hard to analyze, upon his sun-burned, handsome,
self-willed face. &#8220;It is Monsieur le Comte!
My eyes are quick, monsieur. I do not wonder
that you stayed behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Displaying his white teeth mischievously, the
<i>coureur de bois</i>, a deserter from de la Salle&#8217;s
band of Indians and outcasts, waved a brown
hand toward the King&#8217;s Column.</p>

<p>Hot with anger at the insolence of the outlaw
though he was, de Sancerre controlled his temper
and said calmly, but in a tone of voice which had
a restraining effect upon the bushranger:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a long story, Jacques! I found a Spanish
princess in a city built by devils. You&#8217;ve come
to me in time to take a hand in a merry little war
between the sun and moon. No, Jacques! You&#8217;re
wrong. I can read your mind at once. You
think the wilderness has robbed me of my wits.
But come! There is much to do, and I must
question you about my captain and why I find
you here alone. Bring that nut-fattened turkey
up the hill, and we will work and talk and make
what plans we may.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>The outlaw, whose life had been one long protest
against the authority of other men, arose
from the ground, with lazy nonchalance, and
gazed down at the wild-fowl which de Sancerre
had shot. The Frenchman had turned away
and was breaking his path through the long, dry
grass toward the crest of the hill, from which
Do&ntilde;a Julia had been watching a rencontre the
outcome of which she had no way of predicting.</p>

<p>Jacques Barbier gazed alternately upward at
the retreating figure of de Sancerre and downward
at the wild turkey at his feet. Then, with
a protesting smile upon his symmetrical, but half-savage,
face, he bent down and raised the fat
fowl to his shoulder and followed Monsieur le
Comte toward the King&#8217;s Column. De Sancerre
had gained for a time&mdash;short or long, as the case
might be&mdash;an ally whose woodcraft was as brilliant
as his lawlessness was incorrigible.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Jubilate, se&ntilde;ora</i>,&#8221; cried the count, as he approached
Do&ntilde;a Julia. &#8220;The saints have been
more than kind! They have filled our larder,
doubled our fighting force, and made me younger
by ten years. But, se&ntilde;ora, &#8217;tis not a pious friend
whom I have found! This same Jacques Barbier&#8217;s
a devil, in his way. Wear this, my dagger, at
your waist, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>! I know that you dare use
it, should the need arise.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />


<small>IN WHICH DE SANCERRE&#8217;S ISLAND IS BESIEGED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<i>Pardieu, Monsieur le Comte</i>, I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er forget
the scene!&#8221; remarked Jacques Barbier, puffing
his pipe and lazily watching the smoke as the
evening breeze tore it into shreds. Nearly a
month had passed since the <i>coureur de bois</i>, with
a wild turkey, had helped to make a single shot
from de Sancerre&#8217;s musket worth its expenditure
of powder and ball. During that period, Jacques
Barbier, obedient, docile, knowing every secret
of the woods and waters, had been a source of
never-ending comfort to the French count. With
a tactfulness which he would have been incompetent
to employ a year before this crisis, de
Sancerre had attached the Canadian youth to his
fortunes without arousing the restless, reckless
spirit of revolt which made a <i>coureur de bois</i>,
in those wild times, an unreliable ally and a mutinous
subordinate.</p>

<p>There were, however, other things besides de
Sancerre&#8217;s diplomacy which had tended to keep
Jacques Barbier contented with his lot for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
time being. The necessity for obtaining food
without betraying their hiding-place to savage
men, hot upon their trail, had taxed the Canadian&#8217;s
ingenuity and had aroused his pride as a woodsman.
He had listened with close attention to
de Sancerre&#8217;s tale, and had agreed with Do&ntilde;a
Julia that the sun-worshippers would not abandon
the quest of their goddess as long as their resources
for her pursuit held out. By Barbier&#8217;s
advice and assistance, de Sancerre had erected
two small huts upon an insignificant island in
the western branch of the great river&#8217;s mouth,
and here they had passed several weeks in peace
and plenty, weeks which had restored brilliancy
to Do&ntilde;a Julia&#8217;s eyes and color to her cheeks and
lips, while they had revived her champion&#8217;s spirits
and had brought back mincing lightness to his
step and gayety to his ready smile.</p>

<p>Their retreat had not been invaded by the
degenerate savages along the river-banks. Now
and then they would catch a glimpse upon the
river of a distant canoe in which copper-colored
sportsmen were attempting to lure the ugly catfish
from the muddy waters of the turgid stream,
and once, far to the northward, they observed a
war-canoe putting out from the eastern shore
and urged up-stream by paddles which glistened
in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Once in awhile, Jacques Barbier would return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
from the forest, laden with game-birds, to tell a
highly-colored story of redmen whose keen eyes
he had avoided through the potency of his marvellous
woodcraft. But the month of June,
known to the sun-worshippers as the moon of
watermelons, had reached a ripe age, and the
island&#8217;s refugees found themselves well-housed,
well-fed, and free, as far as they could observe,
from the machinations of cruel foes. Sanguine
by temperament and easily influenced by his
environment, de Sancerre had put himself into
opposition to the belief, held by Do&ntilde;a Julia and
Jacques Barbier, that the sun-priests and their
tools would descend to the gulf, by land or water,
in search of Coyocop. He had eliminated from
his mind the thought of peril at his back and
had turned his face toward the sea, thinking
only of succor from a passing ship.</p>

<p>It was with the hope that European sailors
would come to them from the gulf that de Sancerre
had fastened a piece of white canvas, which
he had found among the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of de la Salle&#8217;s
encampment, to the top of the King&#8217;s Column.
From where he sat at twilight in front of the
rude hut occupied by Jacques Barbier and himself,
de Sancerre could look across the narrow
streak of water between his island and the main-land
and see his signal of distress flapping lazily
in the evening breeze. Now and then the bright,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
restless eyes of the <i>coureur de bois</i> would rest
protestingly upon the white flag. To his mind,
the rag was more likely to bring upon them
enemies from the woods than friends from the
lonely sea. Jacques Barbier hated the ocean with
an intensity only equalled by the fervor of his
love for the forest wilds.</p>

<p>On the evening to which reference is now made,
the <i>coureur de bois</i> had grown unwontedly loquacious,
as he smoked his evening pipe, and
glanced alternately at Do&ntilde;a Julia and de Sancerre,
as, hand clasped in hand, they listened to the
usually taciturn Canadian&#8217;s account of the ceremonies
attending the erection of the King&#8217;s Column
and the Cross of Christ.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Pardieu</i>, Monsieur le Comte, I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er forget
the scene! We, that is your countrymen and
mine, were mustered under arms, while behind
us stood the Mohicans and Abenakis, with the
squaws and pappooses whom they had brought
with them to make trouble for us all. P&egrave;re
Membr&eacute;, in full canonicals, looking like a saint
just come to earth from Paradise, intoned a Latin
chant. Then we all raised our voices and sang a
hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">&#8220;&#8216;The banners of Heaven&#8217;s King advance,</div>
<div class="verse">The mystery of the Cross shines forth.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The Mohicans and Abenakis grunted with excitement
and the pappooses yelled. &#8216;<i>Vive le Roi!</i>&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
we shouted, to drown their clatter, and then
your captain&mdash;may the devil fly away with his
surly tongue!&mdash;raised his voice and claimed for
the King of France and Navarre possession of
&#8216;this country of Louisiana&#8217;&mdash;with the right to
put a tax upon every peltry which we poor
trappers take. Gar, it is no wonder, Monsieur
le Comte, that we who risk our lives within the
woods should feel small reverence for a king so
far away, whose harsh enactments have made us
outlaws in the land where we were born. Mayhap,
monsieur, you have good cause to love the
King of France! In that, you differ from Jacques
Barbier.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia felt de Sancerre&#8217;s hand grow cold
in hers and heard him mutter something beneath
his breath, the burden of which she did not catch.
The truth was that the random shot of the
<i>coureur du bois</i> had touched the French count in
a sensitive spot. What better reason had he for
loyalty to the Tyrant of Versailles than this
vagabond of the woods, who, even in the most
remote corners of a trackless wilderness, still felt
the sinister influence of a selfish despotism exercising
a wide-spread cruelty begotten of egotism
and bigotry? Had not de Sancerre known the
fickleness of royal smiles and frowns, the ingratitude
of a monarch who, at the instigation of a
priesthood, could sacrifice a brave and loyal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
subject without granting him a chance to speak
a word in his own defense?</p>

<p>&#8220;In good sooth,&#8221; murmured de Sancerre to
himself, &#8220;his tongue has cut me deep! What
cause have I to love the King of France? I
knelt in homage at his column there, but
methinks my knee and not my heart paid tribute
to <i>le Grand Monarque</i>! Somehow, this
mighty wilderness makes rebels of us all! <i>Ma
foi</i>, Jacques Barbier,&#8221; he cried aloud, &#8220;what is
it that you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>coureur de bois</i> had sprung to his feet and
was sweeping the shore of the main-land with a
quick, piercing glance which cut through the
darkness which the moon, soon to show itself in
the east, had not yet overcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Request the Princess&#8221;&mdash;the title by which
Jacques Barbier designated Do&ntilde;a Julia de
Aquilar&mdash;&#8220;request the Princess, Monsieur le
Comte, to retire to her hut for the night! There
are men stirring upon the further bank who are
neither Quinipissas nor Tangibaos. I fear, monsieur,
that you have underrated the persistence
of your foes who make the sun their god. Unless
I never knew the woods, there are stalwart
strangers in the bushes over there. Go you, monsieur,
and watch the river, while I keep an eye
upon this bank. Gar, &#8217;twill be a pretty fight,
Monsieur le Comte! Your hand is steady?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
<i>Bien!</i> The moon will soon be up. Keep close
to earth when you have reached the river!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, Jacques Barbier, I like the way you
talk!&#8221; whispered de Sancerre. &#8220;But, tell me,
we&#8217;re short of bullets, are we not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; grunted the Canadian, gruffly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve none to waste upon the waters or the
trees, Monsieur le Comte! Bear that in mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; exclaimed Do&ntilde;a Julia, to
whom Jacques Barbier&#8217;s French <i>patois</i> was an
unmeaning jumble of more or less unrecognizable
words when he spoke rapidly: &#8220;Tell me,
se&ntilde;or, has he seen the sun-priests on yonder
shore?&#8221; Her hand was like a piece of ice in
his clasp, as de Sancerre led the girl toward
the hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>,&#8221; answered her
lover, frankly. &#8220;There are men stirring upon
the bank, but I cannot believe that they are from
the City of the Sun. But if they are, my sweetheart,
there are those among them who will
never look upon their mud-baked homes again!
&#8217;Tis strange how a fat larder restores the fighting
spirit to a man. A month ago my stomach
loathed a battle. At that time, all that it wanted
was a bird. To-night, if you were far away,
se&ntilde;ora, I&#8217;d take rare pleasure in doing moon-tricks
when the moon is full. And so adieu, my sweetheart,&#8221;
he whispered, pressing his lips to hers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
ere she bent down to enter her rude cabin.
&#8220;When you hear my musket speak, you&#8217;ll know
an enemy of yours has need of prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long after this that de Sancerre
made good his boast, although Jacques Barbier
began the battle of the night. The French count
had dragged his musket and his crouching body
through the long grass toward the eastern shore
of the small island, and had taken one sweeping
glance at the river, over which at that instant
the risen moon had thrown a flood of silvery
light, when behind him he heard the roar of the
Canadian&#8217;s deadly gun. But de Sancerre had no
time to think of his faithful ally at that critical
moment. Almost upon a line with the island,
and coming straight toward it, two heavily
manned war-canoes of the sun-worshipers rose
and fell upon the moon-kissed flood. The imminence
of his peril acted upon de Sancerre like a
draught of rich, old wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;What reckless fools these be!&#8221; he exclaimed,
taking careful aim at the nearest canoe, now
within a hundred yards of his grass-grown
shooting-box. &#8220;Be faithful, <i>ma petite</i>! The
time has come again!&#8221;</p>

<p>The thunder of de Sancerre&#8217;s gun chased the
echoes from the musket of the <i>coureur de bois</i>
across the glimmering flood.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi!</i>&#8221; muttered de Sancerre. &#8220;Saint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
Maturin is wide awake to-night! That bullet
did its work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reloading his musket with all possible speed,
the Frenchman, with a grim smile upon his face,
drew a bead upon the second canoe, which had
now forged ahead of the boat-load upon which de
Sancerre&#8217;s fatal shot had exercised a demoralizing
effect. Meanwhile, Jacques Barbier&#8217;s gun
had spoken twice, for he had learned to reload
his weapon with a celerity only acquired after
years of practice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, now, <i>ma petite</i>,&#8221; muttered de Sancerre.
&#8220;You have a record to maintain. <i>Adieu,
monsieur!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>A paddle and its dusky wielder fell into the
black-and-white flood, and a moment later the
two canoes had retreated to mid-stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gar, you shoot well, Monsieur le Comte!&#8221;
exclaimed Jacques Barbier, creeping to de Sancerre&#8217;s
side. &#8220;If our bullets could have children,
we could hold this island for a year! There is
no danger from the forest for a time; and, I
think, those boats will not come near us for an
hour at least. These be the demons from your
City of the Sun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no doubt about it!&#8221; exclaimed de
Sancerre. &#8220;It must amaze them to meet so much
moon-magic, although the moon is full. What
think you, Jacques, will be their next attempt?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>&#8220;They&#8217;ll hold aloof, Monsieur le Comte, until
their courage rises or a cloud obstructs the moon.
&#8217;Tis best, I think, that we patrol our fort. You
pace the island to the right. I&#8217;ll meet you half-way
round, and then return. Unless our bullets
fly away too fast there is no danger&mdash;for this
night at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think you, Jacques Barbier, they saw the
maiden&mdash;Coyocop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gar, &#8217;tis certain, is it not? Their bold attack
by boat and shore was not the outcome of a
clumsy chance. They knew that she was here,
and thought that you could not defend the
island on both sides. But this is not the time for
talk, monsieur. <i>Marchons!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour passed by, and the island&#8217;s sentinels
could find neither upon land nor stream sure
proof that the sun-worshipers meditated an immediate
renewal of their attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, se&ntilde;ora,&#8221; cried de Sancerre, abandoning
his patrol for a time to have speech with
Do&ntilde;a Julia&mdash;&#8220;tell me what it means! They
found two guns awaiting them instead of one.
But they have come in force by wood and stream.
They have no skill in war, if this is all their
fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be patient, se&ntilde;or, they will come again,&#8221; remarked
the Spanish maiden, unconsciously suggesting
by her words the influence which de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
Sancerre&#8217;s mind held over hers. &#8220;They have concealed
themselves, to talk of many things which
worry them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Par exemple?</i>&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre, thrusting
his hand through the opening to her hut, to
clasp hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;They know that I am here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You feel sure of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But they will not return to-night&mdash;for
all night long the moon will shine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Pardieu</i>, I do not follow you, se&ntilde;ora.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis clear to me,&#8221; said the girl, firmly. &#8220;Somehow,
I seem to read their minds, as if the saints
were speaking to my soul. They fear that your
white witchery, when the moon is full, is more
fatal than they had dreamed. They will await
the rising of their god, the sun, before they try to
capture me again. Be convinced of this: they
will attack you, se&ntilde;or, just at dawn. I know
their hearts and habits well enough to feel assured
that what I say is true. They are not
cowards, but they dread the magic of your deadly
guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But listen, se&ntilde;ora. I fought them in the sunlight
once before. They know that <i>ma petite</i>
can kill by day,&#8221; argued de Sancerre, hoping
against hope that, for the sake of their scanty
store of bullets, the girl was right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, se&ntilde;or, that I read their evil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
minds. They think their god, the sun, more powerful
at dawn than later in the day. The Great
Spirit, so the sun-priests say, is not unlike a man,
and takes a long <i>siesta</i> at high noon. They have
attacked you now at noon and in the night.
They will not tempt your wizard gun again until
their shining god is wide awake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi, ma ch&egrave;re</i>, your woman&#8217;s wit has
wrought a miracle, I think!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre.
&#8220;I owe an altar somewhere far from
hence, if what you say is true. And so I&#8217;ll leave
you, sweetheart, for a time. I must have speech
with Barbier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome, monsieur,&#8221; cried the <i>coureur de
bois</i>, as the Count approached him from behind.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve watched the shore until my eyes are hot,
and cannot see a sign of living thing. The river
and the woods suggest that we were scared by
ghosts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, Jacques, you&#8217;ll find our foes were
made of flesh and blood! They will return in
force at dawn!&#8221; exclaimed de Sancerre, throwing
himself upon the long grass at Barbier&#8217;s
side.</p>

<p>The <i>coureur de bois</i> glanced at the ragged,
white-faced patrician at his side with a satirical
gleam in his restless eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve learned your woodcraft with great
celerity, Monsieur le Comte,&#8221; he exclaimed, sarcastically.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
&#8220;Mayhap the saints have told you
what would come to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre smiled coldly. &#8220;&#8217;Tis neither woodcraft
nor the saints to whom I owe my thanks,
Jacques Barbier,&#8221; he remarked, quietly. &#8220;I am
a seer and prophet through the goddess Coyocop.
And now, young man, I&#8217;ll let you watch
awhile, and get a wink of sleep. I&#8217;ll need a
steady hand at dawn. Arouse me in an hour,
and I will take my turn at watching peaceful
scenes. Good-night, Jacques Barbier. Bear this
in mind. We&#8217;ll have to fight an army when
the sun comes up.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later de Sancerre lay out-stretched
beneath the moon in dreamless sleep, while the
<i>coureur de bois</i>, pacing restlessly the little island,
nursed his wounded pride, and wondered
if the morning would teach him something new.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br />


<small>IN WHICH THE GREAT SPIRIT COMES FROM THE SEA<br />
TO RECLAIM COYOCOP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Coyocop&#8217;s</span> prediction was fulfilled at dawn.
The year which Do&ntilde;a Julia de Aquilar had passed
in the City of the Sun had enabled her to read
aright the minds of the sun-worshippers after
their moonlit attack upon de Sancerre&#8217;s island
had been repulsed. They had awaited the coming
of their gleaming god, and had been rewarded
by a sunrise whose splendor should have
filled their childish souls with love and peace.
But the mounting orb of day was greeted by its
idolaters not with gentle hymns of praise, but
with wild, warlike shouts, that echoed from
the woods and across the flood with a grim,
menacing persistence that sent a chill through
the hearts of a maiden and her lover, and caused
a dare-devil from the northern woods to look
with care to the priming of his gun.</p>

<p>For the first time since Jacques Barbier, in a
fit of temper caused by some fancied slight put
upon him by the haughty de la Salle, had deserted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
the great explorer&#8217;s party, trusting confidently
to his own skill as a woodsman to carry him
safely back to Canada, the <i>coureur de bois</i> had
regretted, momentarily, his reckless self-confidence.
Had he remained with his captain, he
might have been, at this time, half-way up the
river toward the forests which he knew and
loved; and here he was, at the dawn of a day
made to give joy to a runner-of-the-woods, surrounded
by gigantic, fierce-eyed warriors, already
raising hoarse shouts of triumph for the easy victory
which seemed to lie within their reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gar!&#8221; exclaimed Barbier, as he raised his gun
to his shoulder. &#8220;Service with de la Salle was
hard, but &#8217;twas easier than death. But, then,
&#8217;tis time for me to die. When a wandering outcast
from the Court of France comes here to tell
me what will happen in the woods&mdash;and, <i>pardieu</i>,
he told me true&mdash;there&#8217;s nothing left in
life for poor Jacques Barbier!&#8221;</p>

<p>A few moments before the <i>coureur de bois</i> had
elevated his musket, to begin a battle against
overwhelming odds, de Sancerre had said farewell
to a heavy-eyed, pale-lipped maiden, who
had spent the night in prayer, fearful of the
peril which the dawn would bring to a brave
knight-errant who had grown dearer to her loving
heart with every day that had passed. Well
Do&ntilde;a Julia knew that captivity, not death, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
be her lot should the sun-worshippers reach the
island, but that they would grant mercy to de
Sancerre she had no hope. The thought of life
without the man whose love had come to her
as the rarest gift which Heaven could bestow
was a horror which drove the color from her
face and robbed her voice of everything save
sobs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, sweetheart, if the worst should
come to me,&#8221; said de Sancerre, with forced calmness,
bending down to press his cold lips to her
trembling hand, &#8220;that your brave, earnest heart
has taught me how to live and how to die. Pray
to the Virgin, who holds you in her care, to keep
me always worthy of your love, &#8217;though death
should come between us for a time. Adieu,
<i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>! God grant &#8217;tis <i>au revoir</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl clung to his hand, wet with her tears,
and strove in vain to speak, to put into halting
words the love and despair which filled her soul.
For an instant her white face looked up at him
from the entrance to the hut, and de Sancerre
bent forward and kissed her hot, dry lips.</p>

<p>A moment later he had crawled through the
tall grass toward the eastern shore of the island
and lay watching, once again, the two war-canoes
of the black-haired, black-eyed, black-hearted
savages who had turned from their adoration
of the sun to begin anew their devil&#8217;s work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
Suddenly a shower of feathered, reed-made arrows
whizzed above the gleaming waves, deadly
from the speed with which long acacia bows endowed
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>, the sun-wasps begin to sting!&#8221; exclaimed
de Sancerre. At that instant he heard
Jacques Barbier&#8217;s gun, warning the sun-worshippers&#8217;
land-force not to launch a canoe from the
shore nearest to the island.</p>

<p>The Count and the Canadian, an hour before
sunrise, had divided the store of bullets which
remained to them, and had found that only a
dozen shots from each musket stood between
them and certain death.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how a miser feels as he counts his
gold,&#8221; soliloquized de Sancerre, as he aimed his
gun at the canoe, from which a broadside of
arrows had been launched at his coigne of vantage.
&#8220;Here goes number one, <i>ma petite</i>! There
are only eleven more to defend a Count of Languedoc
from the life to come! <i>Bon matin,
monsieur!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>To de Sancerre&#8217;s chagrin and dismay, the
brawny, brown paddler at whom he had aimed
his musket had defied moon-magic at the dawn
of day. The Count&#8217;s precious bullet had done
no harm to the oncoming canoe, nor to the war-party
which it held. Cold with the horrid possibilities
opened up by his indifferent marksmanship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
de Sancerre, with hands which trembled
annoyingly, attempted to reload his gun in time
to prevent the imminent landing of the howling
bowmen. That his shot would have come too
late the speed of the canoe made evident, when
a crash, almost at his very ear, nearly deafened
the astonished Frenchman for a time. Jacques
Barbier, having checked momentarily by his
marvellous skill with his musket the attack from
the main-land, had come to de Sancerre&#8217;s defense
in the nick of time. But the <i>coureur de bois</i>
paid dearly for the support that he had given
to the unnerved Frenchman. An arrow, shot
by a dusky warrior more daring than his companions,
had made answer to Jacques Barbier&#8217;s
fatal bullet and had entered the Canadian&#8217;s
breast just below his dangling tobacco-pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother Mary, that is enough!&#8221; groaned the
<i>coureur de bois</i>, writhing upon the tousled grass
by his horrified comrade&#8217;s side. &#8220;<i>Courage, Monsieur
le Comte!</i> Let them have your charge!
I have just life enough left to load my gun
again. Wait! Your hand trembles! <i>Bien!</i>
Fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre&#8217;s musket roared once again and
his bullet found its way to the heart of a foe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take my gun, monsieur,&#8221; gasped Barbier.
&#8220;I made shift to load it&mdash;but, gar, this is death!
Ugh!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>A hero at the end of his short, wild life, the
<i>coureur de bois</i> lay dead upon the shore.</p>

<p>At that instant the waters of the gulf and the
river&#8217;s mouth vibrated with the thunder of an
explosion which, to the ears of the startled sun-worshippers
upon the main-land and in the crowded
war-boats, sounded like moon-magic gone mad
with victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Nom de Dieu</i>, it is the cannon of a ship or
my ears are haunted by Jacques Barbier&#8217;s gun!&#8221;
exclaimed de Sancerre, eyeing the retreating canoes
as he stealthily raised his head above the
underbrush and then cast a searching glance
toward the sun-kissed sea. To his amazement
and joy, his gaze rested upon a clumsy carack,
loaded deep, coming to anchor not half a mile
below the island upon which he stood. A puff
of smoke arose from the great ship&#8217;s bow at that
moment, and again the astonished woods and
waters reverberated with an uproar new to the
ears of a hundred terrified warriors, who had
come forth to recover a goddess and had been
met with the awful chiding of the Great Spirit,
who had sent a mighty vessel, larger than their
wildest dreams had known, to carry Coyocop
back again to God.</p>

<p>With his heart throbbing with many varied
emotions, de Sancerre had reluctantly turned his
grateful eyes from the sea, no longer a lonely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
cruel waste of tossing waves, toward the forest
to the westward, into which the land-forces of
the disorganized sun-worshippers were scurrying
in mad fear of an avenging deity, when he felt a
light hand upon his arm, and, turning quickly,
gazed down into the dark, glowing eyes of a
maiden whose trust in the saints had not been
betrayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the hut I knelt in prayer,&#8221; whispered Do&ntilde;a
Julia, from whose face shone the light of a soul
that had known deep sorrow and great joy,
&#8220;when I heard my father&#8217;s voice, telling me
that help was near. Oh, se&ntilde;or, the wonder of it
all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks to me a miracle, indeed!&#8221; exclaimed
de Sancerre. &#8220;There seemed to be no hope when
Barbier was hit! He died, se&ntilde;ora, the death of
a true man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hand in hand, they stood for a time gazing
down at the brave, liberty-loving runner of the
woods, whose clean-cut, handsome face had kept
its firm, symmetrical outlines through the agony
of sudden death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me back again my dagger, sweetheart,&#8221;
said de Sancerre, turning sadly away from a grim
picture of manly vigor cut down in its youthful
prime. &#8220;I did Jacques Barbier a cruel wrong!
He was too brave a man to do a coward&#8217;s deed!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_296.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;HE FELT A LIGHT HAND UPON HIS ARM, AND GAZED DOWN INTO THE<br />
DARK EYES OF THE MAIDEN&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>&#8220;They&#8217;re manning a boat to come to us!&#8221;
exclaimed the Frenchman a moment later, as he
and Do&ntilde;a Julia turned again to gaze at the great
carack, rising and falling upon the early morning
tide. &#8220;It is a Spanish vessel, sweetheart!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Si</i>, se&ntilde;or. There is no doubt of that! I cannot
read the flag she flies, but &#8217;tis some Spanish
merchant-man bound west for Mexico.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Sancerre slipped an arm, covered with velvet
rags, around the slender waist of the girl,
whose sweet face had gained new beauty from
the mighty miracle which the saints had wrought
in her behalf.</p>

<p>&#8220;They heard our guns at dawn across the sea,
and saw my canvas flapping in the breeze,&#8221; he
said, musingly. &#8220;At last, by chance, the King
of France has done me a good turn! He owed
me one, se&ntilde;ora. My sword has served him well,
but when it made a slip, which love itself forgave,
he turned his face away, and left me, sweetheart,
with no land to call my own!&#8221;</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Julia looked up at her lover with a
bright smile upon her curving lips, and her eloquent
eyes told of a joyful heart, as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If so my countrymen in yonder boat are kind
enough to take us, se&ntilde;or, to the West, we&#8217;ll find
a province which belongs to me. If you will
deign to make my realm the land of your adoption,
I pledge my word to be a gracious queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Falling to one knee, with the airy grace of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
courtier who had never known the manners of
the woods and wilds, de Sancerre pressed the
girl&#8217;s hand to his smiling lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, within sight of a column bearing the
arms of France and Navarre,&#8221; he cried, gayly,
&#8220;I forswear all allegiance to other kings than
Love, and hereby pledge my life and heart and
sword to the service of my queen, whose hand I
kiss!&#8221;</p>

<p>The salt breeze from the playful sea, smiling
beneath the bright June sun, brought to their
ears at that moment the sound of a small boat
scraping upon the beach, and the rumble of oars
clattering against dry wood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sun was sinking toward the West, and the
King&#8217;s Column, after a long interval of silence,
spake complaining words to the Cross of Christ.
&#8220;&#8217;Twill be more lonely for us now than heretofore,&#8221;
grumbled the tall pillar, above which a
shred of soiled canvas hung, heavy and limp,
flapping lazily now and again against the wooden
sides of the royal herald. &#8220;In yonder ship,
whose sails resemble golden wings against the
background of the deep, a man and maiden,
seemingly most worthy of the blessings of this
realm of mine, have taken flight and treated me
with strange ingratitude. I marvel that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
should in such wise spurn my royal master and
the haughty arms of France.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Cross of Christ said nothing to soothe the
wounded pride of the pompous pillar, towering
above the humble emblem of an all-conquering
faith in the crimson light of the waning day.
Mayhap the Cross had no time, at that sad
moment, to give to happy lovers, sailing through
the glowing twilight toward a land of peace and
joy. At its base lay a newly-made grave, within
which slept the body of a youth who had loved
God&#8217;s world and hated the tyranny of men.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
